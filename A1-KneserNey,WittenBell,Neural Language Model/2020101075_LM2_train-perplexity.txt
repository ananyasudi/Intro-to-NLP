 it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you	2.376835369410068
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money	2.61755701255788
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise	2.302930191568095

 at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion	2.2474882366144326
 she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge	3.021587260389618
" "all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?" "yes, all of them, i think	2.9275363510755947
 she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done	3.0206566366358247
" "and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business	2.398591596512923
" "i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?" "she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property	3.0375823856190824
 darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	2.8633699216479194
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows	2.983052298585794
 bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	2.323450952389528
 bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others	3.515280502466189
 we had better not mention it	3.282001797003252
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	2.104453257871469
 darcy	3.272760002376118
 it was then disclosed in the following manner	4.01619651046615
 bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine	2.996783524239487
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible	2.334695112740383
--perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones	2.0203718492224425
 it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	1.8701521363176126
" she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, "come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room	2.6261819885928905
 darcy?" "they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine	3.1524877939172247
 "it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she	3.450836659202876
 darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	2.6326060103971387
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	2.9971773268865207
 as for their mother, mr	3.4338043416079778
 if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him	3.103295401042375
 he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask	3.251377588791344
 collins were once silent	3.3255431749042557
 "what could become of mr	2.857799633165809
--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	2.5778224498823246
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	2.5511440144369733
 she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself	2.316112327328789
 you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it	3.4962899578960327
--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings	3.001242915635455
 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	2.6748124084526195
 darcy by character perfectly well	3.1486551334624124
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former	2.3766854313644354
 what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? if they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	2.3769752382202785
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy	2.4155732507133347
 a carat character is used to denote superscription	2.914377509775507
 bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses	2.7214553090362665
" "in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective	3.58647614550239
 darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm	3.2012586980400317
 darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her	3.059578346344035
 but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name	3.3379182633204443
" and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together	2.8444676873447214
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock	2.8136127877456305
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	2.5439145668477767
 bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	2.742443713676553
 from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	3.622220108792761
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her	2.5213853771508066
 there was no arguing upon such a project	3.0682966296914786

" "mr	2.6327661803993303

 darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words	2.686846673818963
 the tête-à-tête surprised them	3.0727363234203007
 he took the hint, and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "that will do extremely well, child	2.639662422514417
 his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars	2.9941115094945534
 but at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey	2.747611708592215
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	2.6817064875837637
 towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself	3.1995823916081285
 four nieces of mrs	3.369461383523126
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	2.7882335488146706
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn	2.4525283085180676
 bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs	2.2656997916919583
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	2.960501594010278
"--and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr	2.278443028199393
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr	2.6789882498281834
 bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him	2.775638483139417
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr	2.7112865419191783
 "oh! yes--i understand you perfectly	2.84920190245589
 bingley comes, my dear," said mrs	3.279563531353551
 it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn	2.6721207538830956
 darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	2.367757870677857
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention	3.04155401642978
" "ah! you do not know what i suffer	3.6213727093451844
 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour	2.775788712944483
 "what can be the meaning of this!" said charlotte, as soon as he was gone	2.9933218988314425
 when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm	2.300814573282039
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam	3.2264298957960555
 they had frequently been staying with her in town	2.8827638076090567
 "tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's	2.883091123538307
) "well, so much the better	2.934435817260222
 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	3.171449502655615
 bennet replied that he had not	5.075090030821258
 "it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth	3.5631691088633772
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 mr	2.2727881355629616
 "you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her	2.729534582245642
 gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	2.425426704458911
" she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley	3.1046187027243417

 bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would	3.264923401207667
 now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?" "for the liveliness of your mind, i did	2.6678687200411324
" "i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	2.3410966910512694
 he had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	2.3945129595135253
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 perhaps he thought her too young	3.1754232398420252
" "i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	2.9757573048155845
 when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	2.608522627708101
 oh! why is not every body as happy?" elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express	2.2886280748016845
--i must be in town next saturday	3.691344936168891
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	2.302713657030546
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago	2.440094995701108

" darcy mentioned his letter	3.207486683415301
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned	3.2077215070826415
" "you judge very properly," said mr	2.667230030100023
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	3.1266300968492793
 not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive	2.861086391111044
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	2.39585338576045
 darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	4.051898684506944
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry	2.2999007958539783

 it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now	2.7583859830054904
 as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to	2.739027033206817
 chapter xii	3.645473359121465
 gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder	2.329338891565219

 a most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house! it would have suited me in every respect	2.7398772253473656
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	2.83467596656155
 she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	2.4017573106606958
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	3.365381902416513

 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	2.6395762200280575
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word	2.4429538029713784
 when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	3.1751870372186626

 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene	2.512915596534806
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	2.369998626185218

 why does she not come in?" "oh! charlotte says, she hardly ever does	2.867566412902601
 she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	2.918840187330351
 very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	2.3181601768930697

 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	2.3056658917839243
 darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	2.6791267130727308

 darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	2.3464901667380746

 the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants	2.411487426391859

 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	2.3098273958655406
 gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters	2.4879766087597464

 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	3.0142431354092123

 bennet's expectations were fully answered	2.645866434135701

 he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed	3.8250333094893847

 "good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you," cried jane	2.7339718746582435
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	2.314020746055188

 the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	2.387134067877889
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away	2.353093600201955

 they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	3.101936758559572
 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	2.4738562373485555
 calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly	2.7638017939643604
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	3.387282394470754
 but, alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question	2.3057412039542142

 at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready	2.625499521136734
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe	2.504638196426275
 "this will not do," said elizabeth	3.6120530321212576
 "oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately	3.2149283192573024
" "perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	2.973145212558217
 "you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	2.9638784757442544
 bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth, "miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	2.644160191397693

 she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again	2.5720393457374304

--do not you, darcy?" "my style of writing is very different from yours	3.1351815773986065

 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller	2.853472579837021
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah! jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman	2.497945493917875

 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	2.789082815048456
 collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	2.070012546566555
 their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's	3.2653990135099105
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	2.7526166317700116
 elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away	2.390006512479495

" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours	2.616371352602329
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	2.3949909864202072
 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept	2.534322423413122
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr	2.4700345685164447

 "but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well	2.723920788514322

" he should be particularly happy at any time, &c	2.717519512994301
 "now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself	3.5966081161848327
 when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	2.8632795377089546

" elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation	2.569159864395444

--her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment	2.5634273878373564
 "but depend upon it, mr	2.8477165468276806
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	2.197534528965194
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to-day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	2.379604726121923
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was	2.9996909578977538
" "it may do very well for the others," replied mr	2.96971343777183
 "you are too hasty, sir," she cried	3.3868108730601745
" "i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man	2.5368450709719745
 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr	3.318445314939888

 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	3.2251787458660166
 when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr	2.2685392400019846
 in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind	3.30686592856853
 elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them	2.392065985933536

 mamma would like to go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" "yes," thought elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once	2.599089527192433
 they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them	2.7362551472639973

 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	2.661778159228843
 wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr	2.8551264452473006
 at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr	2.2029097480844313
" "it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason	3.027890068771418
 but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	2.2888985563821818
 "and then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	2.572397031218929
 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	2.464167622234716
" she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	2.8681152035882693

 wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	2.5978114545401976

 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved	2.3028448663307164

 collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to mr	2.5396138770317354

 darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	2.4652677902124474

 gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	2.6285705109558717
 this, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that mr	3.6431618457067128

 "_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs	2.8904351801659036

 collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman	2.829875460413473
 bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter	2.66066980369348
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	2.1817920557649835

 to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations	2.426546269915434

--if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry	3.074537554961139
 _i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	2.5717165523561354

 i congratulate her	3.9345477784759617
 after this day, jane said no more of her indifference	3.178225152869048
 to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley	2.784479896104962
 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	3.1531803330106345

 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them	3.0929849588005185
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old	2.6688243842113955
" "his manners are very different from his cousin's	3.053932262966352

 i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	3.198208551182048
 he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	2.8446204712028114
 bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	2.589176774905096

" "that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever heard you utter	2.982030086091022
 you do not look well	3.6893273804626325
 so, do not put yourself to inconvenience	3.3232120955872904
 he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	3.2728134917799476
 gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world	2.391411912103218
" "i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia	3.2401787693912887
 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them	2.1987825306991162
" she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	2.9190091169434313
" "they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	2.4356879518098613
 i told mrs	3.7185194291054997
 my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties	3.104555849063371
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr	2.2332249400160062
 he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	2.669080930141484
 accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer	2.375774415476178
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing	2.8972339559935594
" "that is very strange	3.0222831683618576
 collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help	2.335539977700469
 darcy they had only seen at church	2.85855177447452
 not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr	2.6177956621899314
 bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!" "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he	2.4983199998797443

 but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object	3.3325805457206474
 gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr	3.058650560799877

" "whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes	2.4982803631827477

 bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	2.5982755992692144
 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret	2.885047733244597
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year	2.029460363034667
 darcy! no, no, you shall not deceive me	3.26353477052556

 reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time	3.4637192732664213

 the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr	2.4377857504738576

 bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase	2.4605105261881377

 and in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount	2.7266780299795825
" "yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	2.5056832020553235
 "you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time	2.5276875608634906
' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	2.664299383307067
 and his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	2.0672426111264466

 they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound	2.2793486012218622
--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr	2.8845768583138316

 "i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled	2.64718519485896
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	2.487400985160888
 having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	2.5652442148238364

 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure	2.477997788448708
 but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due	2.612891082359577
 bingley never stirs without him	3.191516370021218
 her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	2.704706425009824
 charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	2.506141920622751
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede	2.3982696476794847

 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	2.7626089206881494

 darcy had been staying there	3.227706053739243
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not	3.1856699115410287
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion	2.4270282150920406
" "if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	2.8084292068027126

" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr	2.3289105377212485
 "his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	2.393769260150026
--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have been in an error	2.934165907532045
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble	2.804803777372895
 as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	2.466695933252459
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents	2.5101967432910834
 it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	2.775349198759751
 she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns	3.4406922568865212
 each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of mr	3.3270277943369497

 then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----" "if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! for god's sake, say no more of his partners	3.1760568529624
 gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	2.205427961070891
 bingley followed his advice	3.4141836266836503
 but my dearest love, tell me what dish mr	2.6148206280936965

 collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	2.332773142085787
 "when you have killed all your own birds, mr	2.657640815579673
 his marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy	2.5505060152981627
 "of a fine, stout, healthy love it may	2.5811441935261255

 they followed her into the dining-parlour	3.485010748723014
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr	2.4356196674097816
 he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security	2.582255189411271
 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves	2.3539997378945823
 with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	3.2100886858519964
 "then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	3.2008891762042264
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	2.511871017201349
 "but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing	2.759338040943735
" another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	2.7401359369262455

 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more	2.744181473035033
 after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display	2.349141320495651
 i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not, but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible	2.8719741039317515

 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable	2.8523668316147193
 when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr	2.7568326848789013
 bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son	2.9025718565660665
_ dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance	2.455077213052993
 her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	2.7345471142460434

 in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there with mrs	2.991848689583025

 the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening	2.6191497757286637
 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained	2.03493655826821

 in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry	2.6275324716527515

 "and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?" "i will make no promise of the kind	2.682236075765932

 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more	2.5948040555079714

 collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted	2.3851067566816337
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	2.621486614194378

 no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village	2.232601781024279
 bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr	2.3430900800361734

 collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man	2.473974758202946
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange	2.7663813472984295
 and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	2.453307101328941
 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr	2.699355146979469

 it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	2.696173639080155
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	2.7683583927641537
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	2.382533963017973

 darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	2.9150808158895973
" to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	2.1742577507162064

 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr	3.375323351521391
 darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	2.035014152082483

 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	2.4501273938480836
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply	2.667787978590436

 but i confess they would have no charms for _me_	2.7702619029969293
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her	2.6188758802005396

 poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful	3.2457424542306996
 as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out	2.6081380811247112
 bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	2.154024282569642
 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	2.6078334318782135
 bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	2.7483591312907842
 darcy danced only once with mrs	2.8617251047550356
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used	2.699585674302111
 "i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried jane	2.328351215640042

 _you_ may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer	2.534971884016229

 "i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about mr	3.5712619071474956
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression	2.2055988752250597
 at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	2.3685517328575423

 every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	2.6685404494641336
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr	2.6479922975528782
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	2.6179539536760768
 they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	3.1993234906414707
 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr	2.843037019017094
 darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	2.349764432165091
 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_	2.35447453048383
 her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	2.543826220859841
 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	2.988296095130775

 it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	2.865966881114682

 collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish	2.1922814657054417

 he scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend	3.524806454406562

 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way	2.3942854320315217
 recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	2.723261579077556

 "i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" "i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation	2.5229452750200427
 even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	2.3917595831248724
 now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature	2.146213157890209

 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr	2.0931317953106254
 there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	2.528820631673229
 the second began	4.068435056836994
 on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr	2.4679231972349593
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	2.2476823428098855
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure	2.252530845564703

" "oh! yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr	3.197197425194577
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	2.448718848143786

 collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	2.5564840206465016

 bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters	2.3256308015489204
 she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there	2.921505066018597

 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	2.4567973955424813

 mrs	2.451664885260972
 collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	2.758637748545951
 collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	2.212988872223464
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire	2.684577298777273

 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	2.731650915505627
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	2.6268589655272776

 it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley, and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea	2.2206163620129153

 bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	2.437451125273606

" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first	2.818716036825764
 collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance	2.672286703762216
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious	2.5972677199095364

 "lizzy, you must not do so	4.417905255475183
 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr	2.6231320020696605
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment	2.3725335068482214
 i am perfectly satisfied	3.650652304545751
" "it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_	2.681300291211336
 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "in vain have i struggled	2.3908324891157773
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	3.169862769902678
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable	2.5977286734994416
 bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together	2.648224438317703

 from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	2.2055326971337466
 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it	2.359059083634782
 gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	2.5348796579200554
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 "i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal	3.3895889069751823
 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth	2.641946358100565
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare	2.732747818617366
 i know no harm of her	3.129456080388272
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with	3.210360087522219
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case	3.1908442302175573
 "aye, there she comes," continued mrs	2.7347929711315486
 eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress	2.494670606441259
 miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	2.3114787330427387
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs	2.477894114899709
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	2.6797991927792073
 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	2.6339765936391992
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	2.08360819545482
 i came to try you	3.237141468798868
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family	2.9542725649040786

 nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	2.34575409624219
 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs	2.492147199710037
 he has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one	2.2946685638923667
 "oh! my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "oh, lord! i don't know	3.0667499378535372
 elizabeth was now to see mr	3.2258304817580785
 "how nicely we are crammed in!" cried lydia	2.6242128967866365
--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome	2.616983016135408
 bennet	3.830308531045556
 i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point	2.3601544157229037
 collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	2.3572730233136627
 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	2.739100816941149
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure	3.041438974313699
 he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	3.150891279659677
 in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner	2.426682073168965
" "indeed, mr	2.906270808392681
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	2.405015723768094
 collins's admiration	3.301722524115561
 i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him	3.0438993663608054

 the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	3.2076289912215046
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr	2.697608350485042

" "what think you of books?" said he, smiling	2.7114270562300398
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him	2.4820058040905235
" "undoubtedly	3.7161170294963406
 before any answer could arrive from mr	2.701058275283996
 he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others	2.9804822200448546

" "you appear to me, mr	3.2763178646525173
 as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	1.9857132267377529
 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	2.83225873235765
" "oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	2.1171308073312773

 your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	2.43572398366428
 wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	2.7400962803726947
 i wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	2.2836969810083514
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care	2.6845532315786587
" mr	2.525723810875897
 "very well	3.753802473333236
 mr	2.2727881355629616
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	2.258886479508548
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	2.197451746401973
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard	2.605001684409464
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton	2.073198845996408

 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	2.5891502668319495
" "remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do	3.690616290874455
 his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	2.507018022638004
 darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr	2.5006462324509546
 mrs	2.451664885260972
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	2.886470941929495
 denny and mr	3.747456027061104
 "you may well warn me against such an evil	2.5499691427017486
 can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	2.3074155657255426
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters	2.329822447438187
 wickham himself?" "no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	2.9350579607644454
 i am most seriously displeased	3.2409534920837775
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	2.5834641915087517
" "well, my dear," said mr	3.0441540446568354
 bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr	2.8858125620813664
 darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?" "because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	2.1273803594084253
" "i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	2.849786291874814
 long has promised to introduce him	3.312071154702968
 darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	2.665391534558334
 she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself	2.785065247190341
 wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony	2.6250137042267934
 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	2.6808481265843094
 since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design	2.6204739074015526
 they have at least that advantage	3.35875856595025
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected	2.601268314167443
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy	2.4108280328432463
 "you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	2.9444555994064476
" while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	2.345017171825256
 the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs	3.428493058485278
 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	2.7337818821203506
 it is a pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	2.155768313805344
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it	2.909642988668947
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring	2.8827042355620303
 but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs	3.5887005817897353
 a little time therefore	3.7077212101841033
 i want to talk very seriously	3.2596845882520116
 miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to _your_ family	2.5544984498227215
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it	2.601037971910185
 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	2.4802292640223187
 "two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge	2.6843066399872484
--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham	2.957394230851761
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	2.6815672570213214
 she saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	3.455606177820148
" "and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?" "the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting	2.0111458791055696
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	2.7612086552024664
4	5.155712955787177
 "so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find	3.3544452205722464
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	2.3992976034381654
 but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled	3.4608851655605273
 "i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring	3.8317036181000104
 collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home	2.5688824324827673
 in three volumes	3.12523149023536
 she is quite a little creature	3.314320019906684
 darcy!" repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement	2.861349322353772
 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation	2.509519394707122
 gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn	2.7686013287880433
 bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	3.2045023661934193

 darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	3.1853557321333854
 a small sum could not do all this	3.103527056164109
 darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	2.544984581098835
 gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday	3.00000410655273
 darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her-- "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer	2.7108711331177093
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	2.627570984250444
 bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	2.7821381580933906

 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced	2.3152979825562894

 bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together	2.566565868591223

 bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	2.608902714391689

 they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	2.272659205969791

 the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	2.8522819714330483
 but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend	2.6153333815716295

 no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	2.1955515069871856

 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter	2.235274168378897

 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when mrs	2.321153654141184

 "i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	2.831330596002132

 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	2.6221229223010973

 our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	2.517350914356466
 his choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing	2.6458989240784283
 bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	2.47649817571908

 her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her	3.548637593593822

 in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief	3.010381645864513

 wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	2.0447258488091546

 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	2.257717786582964

 she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	2.267827279958489
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	3.1376366179980546

 "could i expect it to be otherwise!" said she	3.325282339375565
 she was very equal therefore to address mr	2.7598025318478343
 the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	2.3633957193883175
 he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	2.241731623321577
 his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	2.7805609666568722
 jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected	3.209841412604734
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs	2.6232279353398695

" "but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him	2.5478945672776243
 darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	2.4865187857601776

" the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair	2.7786547405524953
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	2.7904869116268447

 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	2.435989850741548
 philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	2.377625916705373

 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	2.553863237590952
 as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	2.579398623067854
" "i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	2.775437391299103

" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	2.005613625437845
 "there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london	1.9715697683312459

 collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	2.777715297051247
 but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	2.74707721122155
 he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	2.6826247319578376

 with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success	3.0056415504686957
 elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes	2.2008023314775227
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	2.367571682258603
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	2.437199856926349

 every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	2.629815120031114
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	2.5955552970094047

 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	2.9439601645746025

 his character was to speak for itself	3.0385534563613
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	2.6423366432619813

 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	2.0176757952983193
 the motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him	2.7178823475811766

"a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?"

 two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	3.1097167945287145

 wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	2.649430604666834

 wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	2.5799984255884896

 but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice	2.9461841854081925

" "my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	2.493731174705682

" "i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas	2.734859488243114

" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	2.6597933563529153

 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end	2.3548793942313817
 her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome	2.508251388312128

 we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way	2.6165860088583917

"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care	2.324511292687547

 lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	2.3899879204723864

 the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you	2.560481789268113
 it is every way horrible!" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	2.341572536791204
 bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public	2.666949325436356

 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much	2.727739736899983
 gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on	2.5087060914986545
 wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	2.4810739849758705

" after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration	2.512304221820576
 collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	2.196079807169388
 she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is	2.8595643946636256
 he was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty	2.798515797508088
 collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands	2.865938683583016
 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage	2.2635897736638615
 darcy about it, if you had rather not	4.077822681057882

 they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room	2.8497802111563972

 we have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	1.973603084370106
 i knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	2.509736630157413
 i hope you have destroyed the letter	3.2378830985283047

 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while mrs	2.8345983082164676

 from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	2.6610747611610788
--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses	2.183193678102256

 i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name	2.3963529198483107
 how much you must have gone through!" her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while mr	3.2703781108901744
 they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone	2.36413629126901
" "i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him	3.3699331342235785
 gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	2.7969287009367685

" elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	2.302209243329517

 the recollection of what i then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	2.8270791823844283
 collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_	3.0309786314094875

 darcy, you cannot deny the fact	3.247184105268552
 to all the objections i have already urged, i have still another to add	3.184654580153172
 collins as the wisest thing she ever did	2.620020299007147
 "i hope," added mrs	4.105240430907232
 elizabeth now began to revive	3.3065273453549615
 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	2.95645809421377
 at our time of life, it is not so pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing	2.827470140001499
 jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way	3.491233972580857
" "aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	2.5125371308490188
 have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	2.4875007080523646
 "no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night	2.842487586560417
 but enough of this	3.6724049215570824
 bingley might like you the best of the party	3.0559769687427885
 he readily agreed to it	3.5008957543618706
 lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars	2.9234813892751825

 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me	2.5454458784318046
 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	2.2995858159021676
 if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all	2.6671241761751987
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render mr	2.438650593969551
 "your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet	3.1192030292586552
 it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk	2.580977769009353
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 "i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs	2.92789988792308
 mr	2.2727881355629616
 bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr	2.4752412404362345
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again	2.711091902999119
 my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr	2.210149340586447
 "come here, child," cried her father as she appeared	3.0627307387986695
 but of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	2.3008246305710665
 but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	2.6818280188440675
 i hope we may often meet again	3.064060686877289
 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	2.218184862531593
 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	2.5223884276504323
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr	2.73690650491003
" "you are quite right	3.0202003307915435

 but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs	2.4343458072286706
 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c	2.7421290792117885
 collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received	2.6244898004441475
" then addressing her daughter, "oh! my dear, dear jane, i am so happy! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night	2.9058505160982664
 his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	2.6114435733803885
 bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	2.5683983176419556
d	6.069361258210519
 the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	2.3358446173660914
 the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings	2.5521580434916746
 jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light	2.306403020296958
 she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be mr	2.751367932249603
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement	2.8132418864812934

 darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr	2.5644562663939934
 he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	2.509570816031307
 well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him	2.951760776312292

 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?" "i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron	2.931582989501722
--the situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father	2.330501615250758
 she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on	3.2436671060055375
 it amazes me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	2.7465750807575304
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation	2.6403348089862404
 gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little	2.5295524457485894
 mrs	2.451664885260972
 i shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	2.2696024823412437
 darcy looked up	3.976774160220445
 unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	2.3976976106345083
 collins in time	3.942804824514551
 a person may be proud without being vain	2.7722182571291736
 nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law	2.6392451067308604
 your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i come	2.3562808432566174
 he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence	2.7959894955371314
 "how good it was in you, my dear mr	3.308021824694127
" they were all astonished; and mr	3.0986784503516183
 mrs	2.451664885260972

" "nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	3.3214016286927794
 "you have insulted me, in every possible method	4.039891875600749
" mr	2.525723810875897
 he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself	2.565601191428498
" "i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	2.9884392374636173
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	3.283957726598894
 wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house	3.3825276204705594
 it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	2.5950655088061394

 jane was distressed	3.893499724394976
" mrs	2.800684611712201
 she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you	2.503637796102167
 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	2.177758465823895
 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain	2.591749039346327
 to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own	2.4319677377672515
--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead	2.587942697925224
" on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must	3.7761900630510796
 and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and mrs	2.9038482433666775
 "oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable	2.7280570657587524
 i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, william collins	2.365956573116375
 she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	2.7629522062091714
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the trouble of practising	3.0375473203561736
" "how strange!" cried elizabeth	3.1775189544380127
 he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum	2.7021690543878094
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	2.533541600764058

 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	3.2023335566128863
 darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	2.8837580180271485

 gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	3.099044620810552
 bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	2.3827700246115326
 how shall we punish him for such a speech?" "nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth	3.2178955994344633

 it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	2.514294359125891

 collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	2.3772899649040364
