 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	2.2833819907829564

 bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	2.6390748268486997
 collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power	2.7264953688769578

 such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous	1.8922552689796908
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	2.4491969867756382
 bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	2.6390839602048297

 collins first came to hunsford	3.4534034525510973
 she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	2.507807403372875
 but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years	2.7556941830358492

 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	2.5039532522700667

 she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded	2.383625664714784
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	2.51660766516009
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	2.1512943095953587

 but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	2.9557616218411287
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	2.7725414164946187
 he now wished it more than ever	3.0563184894705993
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr	2.2474358851488345

 but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	2.764090744056608
 they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs	1.9025842616138253

--it was kindly meant	3.3639007073559233
 within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	2.665722514752342
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	2.937042767302575
 "oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long	2.6589975845941756

 bennet, was not so well pleased with it	3.8348022047512873
 the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs	2.548170678804663
 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know of it, to another, not to you	2.7408524468625757
 gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	2.8854738723461435
 darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can assure you, he informed me himself	3.1682959202144367
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room	3.0236247545096333
 bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more	2.7478126603195707
 but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you are satisfied	2.7915746957156813
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book	2.262532622260093
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?" "why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear	2.786142557584365
 he was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, "i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_ a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit	2.5498628083175694
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible	2.1342032798992814
 smiles decked the face of mrs	3.219811172622385

 darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet	3.811141884361642
 i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together	3.0798158120526287
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr	2.476229008350173

 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated	3.58834251277349
 you tear them to pieces	3.170503112172478
 bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs	2.68226367973195
 she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	2.65532597118551
 thank god! i have not _that_ pain	3.5534108619726696
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr	2.321460716333774

 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks	2.4007209341706464
 elizabeth was delighted	3.996114973127829
 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr	3.2456348328743747
" "i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully	2.828935375198604
 the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them	2.3347181287288725

 collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence	2.3261231888460747
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	2.7212839613057684

" but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are	3.0536063825540105

" "pray tell your sister that i long to see her	2.6192981988771415

 "and pray may i ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials	2.5029763805235343
 on that head, therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.592361600109462
 do let me ask my partner to introduce you	2.6541961509549434

 lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	2.6242204455880196
 collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	2.4063444460759404
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	2.3561865960010184
 "i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr	3.1255365429255817
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection	2.44378197485658
 he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it	2.6688130789387228
 this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving	2.598453126384695
 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed	2.7109407724155297
 will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him	2.8194207505693782

 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	3.0473040763684596
 lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites	2.673514312501459
" "no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me	3.2905997696584866

 bingley, since you went away," said mrs	3.282188579073676
 we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her	2.534185444817282
 you must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	2.4708986597400537
 "lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living	3.0672770431711673

 at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented	2.7652375681443733
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her	3.520051216734913
 "do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_	2.3576793392506006
--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears	2.780601336734785
 philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason	2.3583096433594855

 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	2.3904004919227853
 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	2.7453298661744516
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment	2.732636299591615
" "i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	2.4642784855374167

 she was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	2.9210401266783466
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more	3.541094035004137

" "is he married or single?" "oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year	2.7132395611318523
 darcy, she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	2.7093143570905274
 elizabeth felt jane's pleasure	4.260123424132947
 hurst were going out	3.448877857586205
 hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation	2.8028917948953658
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing	2.3833819498732582
 he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; charlotte tried to console her	2.599443413663865
 they were hopeless of remedy	3.1276898368757284
 he came to tell mr	3.8482353036443953
" "i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty	2.814848795500206
 it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration	3.4917419910574963
 i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy	3.618527451345009

" "so much the better	2.52233665249997
 bennet's being quite unable to sit alone	2.9406128897964834
 i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	2.3318340982761847
 "i am astonished, my dear," said mrs	3.052067000613834
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	2.4730877416798203
 seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence	2.8068091903493686
" "but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him	2.979199076475762

 she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means	3.0496185276359395
 there was also a postscript to this effect	2.768038415743945

" "oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can	2.2187798098612337

 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	2.3072409062784653
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	2.206515789978207
 when first mr	3.70043968431987
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	2.0282450323739365
 wickham and herself	4.158993452178369
 and _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter	2.7092581470753365
 how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves	2.255209420436132
 jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	2.9300996891652673
 at length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction	2.5800732926769805
 i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun	2.9564923528782376
 darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence	2.5385698115657096
 "pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.7652142776398354
 "he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived	3.435676748492552

 gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write	2.518494465730968
 but lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	3.4260638994679886
 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil	2.4203663373569833
 if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	2.288811862893554

 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully	3.388108392712922
 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs	2.505298199948706
 now what have you to say?" "only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	3.1619717690601252
 lady catherine's great attentions to mrs	2.8840201159307313

 the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	2.4678421508540507

" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing	2.671490693689326
 "why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2.689444294023273
 collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to mrs	2.4214592320654966

--lady catherine then observed, "your father's estate is entailed on mr	2.8812881908033328
 bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings	2.9238578472820804
 and what do you think she said besides? 'ah! mrs	2.5632652216098886
 gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr	3.135386857414585

 his coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it	3.177862323954511
 darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning	2.811220469722543
 he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility	2.44544458204222
 gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror	2.3621819265518704
 darcy	3.272760002376118
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs	2.068068520056909
" "in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	2.4819742696991742

" she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her	2.407079437046651
 i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy	3.296517683873254
 his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go	2.756693653344096
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home	2.666977249482917
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	2.987670011092905
 her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity	2.496334673333269

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce	2.480486958628005
 bennet began repeating her thanks to mr	2.6399385913183

 the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr	2.7521483683206234
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	3.3386641124463763

 but he found, in reply to this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	2.3347439133182366
 has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" "your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	2.8850110110471334

 i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	2.967938819619035
 with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand	2.4891077158533905
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly	2.3852730942264504
--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	2.393779175722103
"--my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	2.3091287066679684

 collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr	3.57720287793694
 but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me	2.8759436286715307
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side	2.7514944614355676
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr	2.5441511470901
" elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more	2.6079932682293845
 i am so grieved for him	3.2618518350574077
 they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs	3.0258698449013646
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open	2.4158600479555705
" "are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way	2.107301488509345
 though mr	4.486004659746587
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	2.6816289849501067
 but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	2.548631257718366
 yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance	2.9598688737162946
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met	2.456051544340901
 darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr	3.0166543254038265

 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them	2.754632377332258
 elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	2.572520179538974

 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2.9489254644849563
 his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	2.735729452501057
" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner	2.368393287293492

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables	2.2686959083366287
 they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr	2.7829167509124066

 to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected	3.8596260436245515
 they met several times, for there was much to be discussed	3.010511161240929
 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood	2.3448241486535415
 collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him	2.729100605502477

 mrs	2.451664885260972
 jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	2.1516882142102363
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2.322708364919255
 "now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy	3.1154578520767484

" "you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth	3.133473022380643

" "i am," said he, with a firm voice	3.5415904914743983
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did	2.513300201725166

 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her	2.422417926473916

 "you used us abominably ill," answered mrs	2.4675134453245735
 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr	2.205512029748821
 "and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	2.5714895153516277

 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	2.5391391711664983
