 it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you	3.5201741981000185
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money	3.743263997766605
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise	3.5916497221569452
 these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you	4.151735790883031

 at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion	3.3190642084839452
 she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge	4.118147256676443
" "all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?" "yes, all of them, i think	3.567146108760986
 she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done	4.2867011701245294
" "and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business	3.1396510257529697
" "i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?" "she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property	4.318205124298519
 darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	4.048808599623249
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows	3.8541254133447884
 bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	3.3520986265664146
 bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others	4.799914840824275
 we had better not mention it	3.965884055224696
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	3.3523019148597912
 darcy	3.102500110013028
 it was then disclosed in the following manner	4.83626031829881
 bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine	4.1604874521508926
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible	3.770912036337286

" she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, "come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room	3.471412671285324
 darcy?" "they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine	3.9525964751024727
 "it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she	4.205625468487935
 darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	4.105288652784579
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	4.573804813295092
 as for their mother, mr	4.086001332248349

 he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask	4.348860693148671
 collins were once silent	4.465150654237493
 "what could become of mr	3.259044630783156
--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	3.638630036453071
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	3.7094917028174
 she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself	3.522528218884051
 you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it	4.735811696611382
--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings	4.175927587573132
 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	3.442071472803393
 darcy by character perfectly well	4.412726117118269
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former	3.5304074988204457
 what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? if they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	3.6496628186906395
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy	3.5490987053169385
 a carat character is used to denote superscription	3.752369030551804
 bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses	4.278965353259459
" "in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective	4.805454549280538
 darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm	3.9160439097977497
 darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her	4.253215354414422
 but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name	4.561974007689608
" and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together	3.929839742697117
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock	3.589696215551655
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	3.7831235589551837
 bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	3.3998106133729267
 from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	5.189895707329521
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her	3.510719101094188
 there was no arguing upon such a project	3.6144589836346936

" "mr	2.561072977360651

 darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words	3.785753425946433
 the tête-à-tête surprised them	3.813722519883264
 he took the hint, and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "that will do extremely well, child	3.5968325346462957
 his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars	4.075271023502051
 but at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey	3.681384785198244
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	3.807227452417525
 towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself	5.0369425224653925
 four nieces of mrs	4.270871573703264
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	3.8765049021359
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn	3.6519687653853765
 bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs	3.1276526557124193
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	4.26674969684445
"--and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr	3.3624701126687007
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr	3.7830827608286564
 bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him	4.138240315915724
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr	3.698699118459371
 "oh! yes--i understand you perfectly	3.6063441707688053
 bingley comes, my dear," said mrs	3.67186109378097
 it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn	3.479623814683158
 darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	3.5953523832031786
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention	4.195089238919755
" "ah! you do not know what i suffer	4.001706715493493
 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour	4.113281952366213
 "what can be the meaning of this!" said charlotte, as soon as he was gone	3.555143555615762
 when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm	3.309788632730572
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam	4.673720617708116
 they had frequently been staying with her in town	3.974224822237838
 "tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's	4.107671077688806
) "well, so much the better	3.2018703351964817
 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	4.345961959280652
 bennet replied that he had not	6.298942505279795
 "it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth	4.8655843767258675
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 mr	2.25373325769127
 "you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her	3.525561437235029
 gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	3.6856584996053754
" she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley	4.0374853253008816

 bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would	4.466648968308938
 now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?" "for the liveliness of your mind, i did	4.2435321421724055
" "i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	3.3435182897074296
 he had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	3.5880933556930383
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 perhaps he thought her too young	4.196664450114116
" "i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	3.8473165981388897
 when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	3.8879230596205074
 oh! why is not every body as happy?" elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express	3.546358184173577
--i must be in town next saturday	4.354144891705786
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	3.219279854085161
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago	3.420165341939886

" darcy mentioned his letter	4.055999520601064
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned	4.32232375608137
" "you judge very properly," said mr	3.2969925811494805
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	4.331385548856345
 not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive	4.2055218909418395
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	3.420126711141929
 darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	5.350473822811602
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry	3.63502731873921

 it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now	4.036282915001463
 as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to	4.125350968779108
 chapter xii	3.5921936763864775
 gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder	3.183514655139365

 a most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house! it would have suited me in every respect	3.9285562988137053
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	4.2606041768734855
 she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	3.5256394539396982
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	3.972339788156314

 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	3.5680261794657935
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word	3.4065441484683525
 when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	4.059611333941862

 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene	3.658040292276818
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	3.456721625908225

 he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "just as you please	3.9351670394133094
 why does she not come in?" "oh! charlotte says, she hardly ever does	4.28025626501641
 she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	4.02139106751669
 very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	3.5890345751573314

 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	3.5384181707867572
 darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	3.839622202961862

 darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	3.7084793450106672

" jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth	3.7995288827574707
 bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them	3.227420014634695
 forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	3.989073662799271

 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	4.211553982209376

--in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	3.8335315878415686
 collins joining in, observed, "yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her	4.236419949777527
 bennet's expectations were fully answered	3.306732905446408

 gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it	3.9758547645728326
 he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed	5.265915105985047

 gardiner	3.6633349090726224
 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did january and february pass away	3.086089846824974

 "good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you," cried jane	3.8488804984456184
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	3.634803014841612

 bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr	3.5977753055400528
 he had been some time with mr	3.668087690933862

" "are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?" "both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds	3.5566646625805363

" "no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical	4.7886970879287425
 collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	3.772114925645773

 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	3.2008827087208322
 bennet protested against any description of finery	3.8045739125707714

 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	4.312808931379254
 lady catherine rose also, and they turned back	4.935480547966987

 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park	3.7085794321304033
 when mr	3.3406664493432516
 the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	3.3062275981448677
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away	3.511389535358473
 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house	3.3651525339272457

 they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	4.040208036587807
 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	3.755601282204631
 calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly	4.315559389660871
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	4.456110340168775
 but, alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question	3.4616118927142336
 * * * * * "good gracious!" cried mrs	2.8097976384045706
" "i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	3.602366991213413

 at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready	3.7850488436113143
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe	3.6804980077692657
 "this will not do," said elizabeth	4.396810031900296
 "oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately	3.6271766465385844
" "perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	3.8137561953640016
 "you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	4.3168792273677425
 bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth, "miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	3.7894659897514202

--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	3.756614793701122
 she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again	3.7628352665218583
 as they drove to mr	3.891024021027077
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	4.391621217535292

 the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles	3.6997035374576828
 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and mr	3.1384321075749306
 she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs	4.028315334175698
 i could hardly keep my countenance	4.351129169092241
--do not you, darcy?" "my style of writing is very different from yours	4.1528158868652065
 elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	3.442572682880776

" "my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you	3.6802058340753625

 "but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable	3.388916503399521
" "i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other	4.187470729879782
 * * * * * in the evening, soon after mr	4.527958973812001
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	3.68855085746867
 philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation	3.408021187289979
 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller	4.001498505166968
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah! jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman	3.812806723984251
 the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification	3.5348106709419134

" mr	2.4876436570257496
 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	4.055399683964767
 collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	3.2146362624050835
 their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's	4.313512103840553
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	4.007262959534149
 elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away	3.3550144677297418

 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs	3.131712442945586
 "it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire	3.9987236648595124
 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as i certainly did	3.4450427449246113
 darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right	3.4337796833904246

 bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr	3.8902822927607743
" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours	3.9502857578537793
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	3.259252094075062
 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept	3.7850610392356625
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr	3.8151098941053223
 but think no more of the letter	4.801412228924609
 "but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well	4.287855488475054
" to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr	3.417045705212112

 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	3.3672215632448657
" he should be particularly happy at any time, &c	3.625604231985916
 "now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself	4.57259350455535
 when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	3.8838209420940735
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable	4.596226378901211

" elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation	3.2132200972710696

 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	3.2236464419832305

 "but depend upon it, mr	2.844807524851276
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	3.208133637781758
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to-day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	3.7734572849536776
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was	4.391646294446488

 when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr	3.4785918822399617

 wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr	4.026073244763536

 to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley	4.32190959120222

" "i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia	3.6007283525556963

 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr	3.625944345069899

 bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase	3.8380044892884557

 but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due	3.8747327918798335

 charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	3.7743564765926045

 as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	3.653037904566415

 gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	3.406308859306396

 when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr	3.8074296074425455

 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	4.166704982422272
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	3.461126500144133

" to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	3.4575657795167976

 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her	3.808277505089832

 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression	3.549658677409518

 it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	3.8116075774982026

 collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish	3.4360300879007593

 he scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend	4.723394446926028

 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way	3.424103006267547
 recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	3.906542224829819

 "i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" "i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation	3.8582169009775864
 even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	3.632868368598926
 now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature	3.3263820574507745

 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr	3.066475468582917

 the second began	5.161617127141759
 on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr	3.5911385799354596
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	3.5033729683317447
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure	3.3724222620021855
 in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	3.763667628908727
" "oh! yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr	3.647027262959718

 collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	3.5994137036602183

 bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters	3.3524387965660964
 she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there	4.164063713438431

 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	3.772789432381368

 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	3.7823982145012605

" elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them	3.7745885217148407
 collins! and what can _he_ have to say?" "something very much to the purpose of course	4.215541866433747

 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	3.565152064448034
 collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	3.4931165589386466
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire	3.84459207614323

 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	4.083367685530076
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	3.328440205337873

--come, kitty, i want you up stairs	4.091387846688895
 it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley, and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea	3.5778861767539922

 miss darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed	3.63976464393842

 when they repaired to the dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister	3.949332010327312
 bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	3.807882109571229

" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first	3.5059629406648485
 collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance	3.8493688385158804
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious	3.904843342844333

 from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	3.3232589680367197
 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it	3.3932545436926
 gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	3.3588313198476767
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 "i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal	4.338534481877761
 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth	3.635009806867471
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare	4.069961889269304
 i know no harm of her	3.9373685019165836
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with	4.2445503830241424
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case	4.434521139744481
 "aye, there she comes," continued mrs	3.771836213300887
 eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress	3.660672558039954
 miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	3.46633580629603
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs	3.517660576767859
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	3.98909221130344
 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	3.6765359127250266
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	3.0632553691560833
 i came to try you	4.041419698316695
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family	4.153135416206701

 he has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one	3.1987282921144837
 "oh! my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "oh, lord! i don't know	3.7035091144367844
 elizabeth was now to see mr	3.6237696441860967
 "how nicely we are crammed in!" cried lydia	3.4497504616668664
--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome	3.7635563659267173
 bennet	3.668863865876446
 i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point	3.246520229331906
 collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	3.368847434614414
 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	3.9596051531127068
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure	4.031729732615629
 he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	4.6623358176121235
 in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner	3.6853575785659336
" "indeed, mr	2.753786831191918
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	3.7696114056002323
 collins's admiration	3.428775937317393

" "what think you of books?" said he, smiling	3.172228542807698
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him	3.8254751035426717
" "undoubtedly	3.9794385604109515
 before any answer could arrive from mr	4.114992806801722

 as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	3.066020066538127

" "oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	3.0155711154310048

 your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	3.701748013539758
 wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	3.8851277144923015
 i wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	3.280902628224508
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care	3.968729311261879
" mr	2.4876436570257496
 "very well	3.8053064293836245
 mr	2.25373325769127
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	3.434109134628226
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	3.512047165461713
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard	4.043324114150478
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton	3.279700460105233

 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	3.673112373356122
" "remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do	5.0628959685427555
 his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	4.036086113101769
 darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr	3.2225724336913593
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	3.9282267907662107
 denny and mr	4.4564831799560665
 "you may well warn me against such an evil	3.0747033768820238
 can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	3.6222176292678268
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters	3.6649423801933074
 wickham himself?" "no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	4.189845719303836
 i am most seriously displeased	4.079791722470419
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	3.5556556278032807
" "well, my dear," said mr	2.817691213579509
 bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr	4.0443594658233275
 darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?" "because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	3.187880973514249
" "i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	3.767189855716367
 long has promised to introduce him	3.933678891290657
 darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	3.560689709427637
 she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself	4.128534643612905
 wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony	3.981713891958761
 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	3.77641603716797
 since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design	4.131741923533262
 they have at least that advantage	4.267153849581698
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected	4.135953989120577
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy	3.8256312509548724
 "you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	3.9678852260240083
" while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	3.569070289276837
 the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs	4.407774196535678
 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	3.9265906984021433
 it is a pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	3.0901272760246097
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it	3.8311061604309686
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring	4.137690677887904
 but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs	4.080374788946035
 a little time therefore	4.739694607836423
 i want to talk very seriously	4.267965889614098
 miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to _your_ family	3.6415546506277363
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it	3.8059023731633372
 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	3.670838859671032
 "two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge	3.9646865832872797
--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham	4.773293550392393
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	3.767350730215767
 she saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	5.0754431666819135
" "and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?" "the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting	3.17478752142814
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	3.7626593877424512
4	5.6203435438901606
 "so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find	4.571801578173508
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	3.594392378597008
 but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled	4.45605982657331
 "i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring	4.162328458884706
 collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home	3.2984891529416154
 in three volumes	3.0321371291718666
 she is quite a little creature	4.2500245410628406
 darcy!" repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement	3.886159120666273
 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation	3.9441065594534463
 gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn	3.845730573340263
 bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	4.222188851536936
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	3.882199829522993
 a small sum could not do all this	3.9831490203321187
 darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	3.4247369198773674
 gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday	4.5376036435261815
 darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her-- "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer	3.7339361179755577
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	4.017206666471635
 bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	4.193931138798878

 bingley urged mr	4.603469194475395

 wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her	4.389748999023155

 bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask	3.801041131388019

 bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	4.387625789085199

 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther	4.172282143361962

 he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	3.4350948905126684
 his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	4.070016891249113
 jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected	4.2575724954968255
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs	3.5747079927417524

" "but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him	3.71543755716256
 darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	3.097426753766102
 collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	3.446391482971589
" the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair	4.136362154614958
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	4.284925968212156
--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read	3.9172756554505286
" "in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	3.72422619991897

 she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	3.513519106096008
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way	3.6697791127319115

" "but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out	3.496327531054585
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been	4.04135984903191
" "money! my uncle!" cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?" "i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am gone	3.585646802553466

 you see on what a footing we are	3.9002786196255275
 if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer	4.138563085757106
 who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it	4.81787458246368
 bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	3.5032665110247487
 bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	3.7292122426962497
 first of all, he asked miss lucas	5.1165870657781065
 but the case is this	4.419034415717032
 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	3.738319276542286
 "and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more than i ever look into	4.237355996203039
 kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy	4.325556771996543
 will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began	4.310080092195086
 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	3.339468489002521
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm	3.766451722883031
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on	3.831507602803938
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before	3.6456021671808743
" "well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it	3.860017797195664
 "we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell!" elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal	3.3336059273128713
" darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject	3.18296075951808
 there is nothing he would not do for her	4.356997895256232
 you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these	3.7672754858880766
 your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done	3.845565963020654
" "i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	3.872559333795365
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	3.705966519946186
 lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off	3.898026523005186
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances	3.3968448189703797
 but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad he is gone	3.7576206114436372

" "miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that i am not to be trifled with	4.665199331538305
 bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend	3.3472802847729994
 mr	2.25373325769127
" "no more have i," said mr	3.4074710306057336
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	4.052384235604142
 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	3.6524147280198247
 philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	3.556947292490949
 but it is of small importance	4.412933892218612
 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr	3.8880880072795323

 as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	3.593576508672616
 my aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing	4.31713478936827
--kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed	5.355938432179726
" their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs	3.0928293198728976
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	3.828133689728786
 as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	3.8827808609226486
" "i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	4.016700508577862
 our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	3.8146115051475773
 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	3.579126304598511
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	3.6913396554177855
 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	3.6631975106508827
 sir william had been delighted with him	3.5554665777413694
 and mrs	2.510724893077244
 the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him	4.402168742382159
" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	3.194859463622954
 "there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london	2.951365870436161
 he has heartily forgiven me now	3.7930381686058348
 he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	3.703991870716702
" "and quite alone? have all her friends left her?" "mrs	3.760533382165949

 wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia once	4.338874966297404
 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	3.9930723920886533
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	3.5423204067573955

 he _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey	3.4614605134171756
 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	4.3070783857841946

 their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves	3.9132175665997964
 mrs	2.4326355335218928
 yes, yes	5.039036500997882
 at last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	4.167350551161863
 collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	3.866241783270845
 collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	3.7072411140620254
 but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	3.859382590267935
 he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	4.130440217386665
 his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking	4.600638331667184

 in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	3.8234786730384456
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success	4.176539050695256
 elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes	3.4691397443609304
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	3.640744659921515
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	3.5217178909120306
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy	4.912681421871048
 every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	3.6889983450040136
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	3.8457084561239623
 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon	3.974526724757604
 wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	3.7523356487777484
 no principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with mr	4.487436613140039
 mr	2.25373325769127
 lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	4.057120853561315
 and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs	4.057991159488146
 there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	4.079472766999791

 he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister	3.6219124092935617
 but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate	3.3362212686473187
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	4.262635867261322

 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	3.941105862410982

 such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined	3.6742691863630057
 collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	3.802816410105816

 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	3.259866047933248
 the motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him	3.9022432576604875

"a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?"

 two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	4.340276826559269

 wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	3.7053485692414814

 he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him	3.5347302904577935

 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end	3.4899714207559454

 lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	3.582465922621885

 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	3.5627592942904

 the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	3.4095403762496326
 the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings	4.037355374820558

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	3.4070414338873416
 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain	3.4914860957163874

 he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum	4.334935471962881
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	3.8695874977904854

 one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	3.7253394077829483

 she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents	3.744098354769371
 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage	4.495749031519507

 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing	3.3259528256341717
 bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	3.5402042605779767
 the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better	4.062562439291922
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley	3.7133590600626425
 gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance	3.693087818599385
 unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring	4.779418924421762
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr	3.707058711405243
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	3.518912528027283
 elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word	3.0655439406737224

 on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "let me call your maid	4.010176779641078

 darcy could have such boundless influence	4.236567017245648
 darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	4.04403331165119
" "no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose	3.910912284412167
 bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	3.205902961375015

 the happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	3.7744988583288386
" elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off	3.7845604142913514

 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals	3.401517927945797

 collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	3.960821744527372
 gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	4.567704444896755
 bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	3.578219320776484

 it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	3.615273206649913

 collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	3.614446860969132
