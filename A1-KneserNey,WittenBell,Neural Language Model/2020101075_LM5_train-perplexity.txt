" " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy ' s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself 56.68523973895516 
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire 70.85668600033699 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 29.976203099986336

my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties 47.54540182893288 
our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 22.049298121683737 
lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr collins , i think 18.1434926065091 
" she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it 40.38120020482466

" indeed , mr bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it " " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 62.63199414824207 
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them 32.434482389173745 
come , kitty , i want you up stairs 7.9977329526932195 
_ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 84.66174119254032 
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself 65.5491719713314 
" " yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 44.60968306875532

" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " " with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic 95.2266608441586 
seriously , i would have you be on your guard 9.083501637744332 
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 43.68329883183045 
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins 29.017247948714765 
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here 17.28760441886091

with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand 42.70142852540797 
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ' clock 14.07965304444971 
" " mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library 47.39816911811036

in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl 50.97496261611045 
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits 9.797528939816956 
" " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies 48.766464345092636 
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled 31.096379682196616

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 38.00796912092002 
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find 27.67435354878409 
" i found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 60.15410492619791 
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his 79.97619011713935

the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other 40.92420607811374 
" aye , there she comes , " continued mrs bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way 39.19985562674571 
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 20.50152034097788 
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty 33.56033017192763 
two days after mr bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask 104.40066279560367 
" " i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 27.511764946448224 
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it 15.719184361326706 
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity 3.8737129382442403 
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together 23.761485550831413 
" " yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded 39.13564657842925 
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness 38.42895187437226 
i will take care of myself , and of mr wickham too 11.095513180437562

she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 24.7972146902046 
" " an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _us_ 20.17159821538158 
" " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 20.125750821234295 
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual 27.603379962787987 
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy 15.02507973642698 
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes 44.68548626507692 
" " i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 21.325009192345057

vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another 29.152008169983585

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 23.181350023515904 
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them 45.55294949098765 
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent 24.49141811867976 
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility 39.75182938257582 
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again 20.371625740978217 
but you are always giving _her_ the preference 7.277781200941214 
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match 17.868042370577335 
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do 37.935967349531445 
" " as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ 31.152623659610583 
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit 13.213785836377959 
" " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 15.159596840371742 
both sisters were uncomfortable enough 4.047286890799467 
" but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine 31.85746397923958 
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 27.119475414612108

" " that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ 25.69415989007427 
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance 43.55010150568008 
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object 11.370967812416298 
" " certainly not ; at first 6.0191885649224135 
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 44.26079139120789 
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 68.96738806716198 
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me 35.112981338795045 
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs hurst were going out 13.29845402289397 
had the late mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life 35.20809468558346 
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 6.992364559933675 
" can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 26.03110571057578 
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech 19.06909602451262

if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the rules is very easy 18.162553431775308 
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer 35.24441499505252 
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night 25.580933434431323 
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent 9.335111843622599 
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain 39.12518315850284 
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 44.49629552704486 
" then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself 16.58376863886774 
we do not suffer by _accident_ 4.992715696737074 
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 16.04305417845434

by mrs hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments 36.18585803335832

he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty 23.966171558409588 
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw 26.983225998996005 
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed 37.230819515549534

but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground 54.620768645986075 
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 25.88570751873004 
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 9.636579637953831 
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart 22.1482748442363 
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little 62.04359087037624

but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 52.70589033728865 
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved 37.05095758437352 
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer 13.394140760190892 
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed " cried jane 12.752556884376107 
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing 20.96714773599653 
mrs collins knew not what to make of him 7.718060057179404

i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy 20.280128717069566 
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? " cried mrs gardiner 12.934229044360118 
" " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? " he shook his head 15.073322716614653 
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected 23.137063541902087 
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him 49.44913649047981 
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully 44.29612434975559 
" and may i ask ? " said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with 21.059261843674978 
at present i am not in love with mr wickham ; no , i certainly am not 15.925387603749606 
" " elizabeth , you are not serious now 8.250006322863053 
" " thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry 27.34181217057765 
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 64.53568388385759 
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be 20.954918003065103 
when they repaired to the dining room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister 35.12320091664138 
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 41.59591223302975 
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride 30.988902785420358 
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton 22.15334636545413 
" " impossible , mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " i honour your circumspection 30.153016582628354 
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business 61.447633139050204 
what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir 19.23077766374526 
" " it is well 3.982884507154388 
she now lost every expectation of pleasure 6.105674131718616 
" mrs bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals 75.21250761611753 
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton 35.06905531303455 
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent 17.210874292245887 
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred 36.79254600876365 
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 29.41407947346253 
" good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you , " cried jane 16.630323088746906 
did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had 19.442374253402093 
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 68.64541940554791 
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am " accompanied by a violent yawn 41.253314172746556 
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may 10.094379619806642 
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance 19.096094489591263 
at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented 13.058955624005241 
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals 25.447908916291624 
" " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him 14.365635854658409 
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 18.43731662418331 
i hope you have destroyed the letter 6.1184079633755015 
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 33.141769536874044 
" how despicably have i acted " she cried 8.211078285378612 
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could 24.02614417107796 
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 41.02689578664111 
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded 53.333465840044724 
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd 9.785446323112108 
" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh mr bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar 40.79127486202782 
she really looked almost wild 4.014339365088719 
we had better go into the avenue 6.152945143985846 
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy 10.965413407778081 
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us 48.058213569855006 
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance 45.01920414946002 
oh how acutely did she now feel it 7.095320418612898 
" " oh thoughtless , thoughtless lydia " cried elizabeth when she had finished it 13.899844415825287 
his disposition must be dreadful 3.948038597312373 
" " you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 19.540988323410073 
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation 17.64508755208638 
" " you have a house in town , i conclude ? " mr darcy bowed 14.880364849470583 
your ' s , c 4.086798678021703 
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea 28.76940250707277 
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire 79.36969681761418 
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them 40.07890417830751 
" " oh , well it is just as he chooses 9.999601350791732 
well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 27.204809487469472 
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again 66.64314723627223 
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr darcy 29.07255680223487 
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before 50.23937656275312 
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment 21.79134125602107 
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him 47.93984200724208 
but your _family_ owe me nothing 4.7342941256424895 
" oh yes i understand you perfectly 6.24487023223917 
" " and mary king is safe " added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 18.91014028844376 
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza 21.66963025199052 
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone 29.764806054178347 
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved 5.214330474619877

what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression 125.16780498794319 
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon 69.99716134283133 
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour 22.382317531702466 
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 30.014822973037536 
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas ' s 29.806064194432885 
when mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten 33.35268002242787 
" " and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr bingley never stirs without him 97.49772069127548 
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried 11.462534218274174 
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do 57.03169486632673 
i thought i should have broke my heart 7.2197321185906915 
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home 34.0205244033682 
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember 18.01864402941875 
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body 22.958280382601227 
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover 63.6198790953126 
" " i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject 24.45470722164372 
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners 18.80134696485486 
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained 119.18793341226583 
" " what is it you mean ? " " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing 44.78376937227219 
wont it , kitty ? " kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 13.740607662250397 
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 46.9712955266675 
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make 73.5878978589838 
" lady catherine seemed pleased 3.9171790945551526 
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go 15.032155647162009 
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home 26.204655367916455 
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder 19.683007896082174 
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her 54.83126652145994 
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 29.30033175569338 
the other is miss de bourgh 5.151291785167541 
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr darcy might have done as well 28.575775451333204 
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet 37.89210702659132 
till this moment , i never knew myself 7.163086758756795 
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him 19.148510633862028

when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were 19.097264528757446 
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice 32.64031044873655 
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be 45.495872342399494 
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid 40.626475938694135 
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr bennet were dead 59.29451494143307 
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word 19.691100648420804 
" oh , jane , take care 6.061304577244346

but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle 35.30417669620339 
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " blame you oh , no 18.418596758142122

in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before 28.100434598796966 
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others 25.31330846451708 
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 49.41473013345406 
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them 32.03304693984026 
" " perhaps i do 4.0077814720203095

" mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 43.058663040657216 
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable 17.29041808735673 
oh lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty 51.67059357668044

the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 64.8252748043032 
at length , she spoke again 5.11022263444167 
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible 9.870749692188808 
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country 74.40599961897625

it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 71.00820499858713

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility 74.6457532268563

" " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this 20.715611546755092 
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 27.8397749661551 
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it 22.92355811296892 
" " and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them 17.142652397437686 
" " let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself 18.257374642334856 
" " that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 25.623330284240332 
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr denny comes back from town 22.273694787539625 
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing 13.948781106869921 
" what can be the meaning of this " said charlotte , as soon as he was gone 17.05408689696634 
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done 26.59127019226841 
" " you know nothing of the matter 6.961389747501632 
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance 32.527288170856764 
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 24.135615529367165 
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town 18.178982755142982 
did you see it ? " bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations 14.921799038011025 
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 25.02284376436044 
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 26.892189802932727 
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her 24.033514196979397 
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 45.52901329341968 
" it must not be thought of 5.995261788591286 
" " oh , no " said elizabeth 7.029845790310497 
" " indeed " " yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 20.986974662171804 
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go 67.7736535254931 
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room 57.3842029772951 
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love 20.283637952054043 
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about 18.829579688117438 
" " i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield 21.651195399632602 
" i wish i could call her amiable 7.272350347294771 
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark 39.42938569796408 
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety 56.38863005150567 
" i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend 27.3806403132795 
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 61.85179786452296 
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements 23.640124270817775 
1 through 1 1.9610500063973482 
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes 12.694644789537417 
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted 9.065387948313152 
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay 12.658071498960261 
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there 27.145024381187202 
it was very little less 4.0723748242323525 
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him 15.172142676065583 
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater 63.22241729407556 
" " well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth 51.022891635514895 
" " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly 35.96924650164376 
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance 64.87002518275094 
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know mr bingley ? " " not at all 80.68108377926994 
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? what do you keep winking at me for ? what am i to do ? " " nothing child , nothing 45.32587068689674 
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all 15.358307821355947 
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others 14.908004895451729 
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement 14.134022719642394 
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time 19.270604511981208 
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger 19.825944815612857 
their reception from mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial 16.245618293258037 
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention 31.330878396333713 
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 57.9273407939536 
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away 12.777572208580073 
" " i do not believe a word of it , my dear 12.458567006906776 
" " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 25.781566397219123 
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution 20.61970962550681 
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself 15.583117707710862 
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever 10.233805842940352 
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride 39.74678810563643 
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 80.78047971842314 
the tête à tête surprised them 5.133401656154401 
" " it did 2.8703982530316723 
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning 22.34626523924617 
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house 43.12715486550904 
i shall never forget her appearance this morning 7.1056016251640255 
see 42671 h 2.0003176559566107 
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us 17.976913305558757 
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever 23.45086916292124 
mr darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ 6.153724169275096 
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all 17.762354636566883 
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit 41.06438057638269 
you are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage 11.16740775960731 
i am quite well 3.0044075631393623 
" " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " both , " replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 46.97030718807755 
special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg tm concept and trademark 33.583712992112474 
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention 6.9607628867740035 
mr gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 12.911753669637166 
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them 63.1091943728616 
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy 32.452862066454315 
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry 41.639451397561345 
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy 18.189406732396723 
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived 19.15628402216693 
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " from the former 36.9014564717313 
" " if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 31.65013753269713 
" miss bennet still looked all amazement 5.917554987405517 
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it 15.590920944159832 
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 8.001911930019615 
bingley urged mr jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 36.765709775464536 
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 15.13351372322616 
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world 21.996078175945943 
" they were all astonished ; and mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness 57.07362259201911 
1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm license 16.006777790120704 
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit 14.602591063906948 
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy 43.79539971855143 
" " and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well 14.153820254163309 
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy , who sat opposite to them 52.244921386506284 
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 21.74090129105174 
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 26.558512852241552 
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 37.62388410699352 
" " and do you impute it to either of those ? " " yes ; to the last 18.30946077557954 
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor 24.104339326348395 
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows 15.031205434530921 
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is 54.464363431928746 
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 16.99536484771282 
" after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration 49.24344453951634 
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid 35.04982330345537 
" " ah you do not know what i suffer 9.049446218288077 
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition 13.916227125952512 
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 14.849376326738927 
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 42.15697943162503 
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way 48.319331730684674 
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end 59.09889439830149 
pray do not talk of that odious man 7.100875869713213 
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away 32.130677697341426 
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 10.457710833787374 
lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself 25.09990446868889 
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings 38.70799171449441 
she will follow wherever lydia leads 5.121510888151275 
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 28.211389586767623 
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude 12.6848739722192 
" he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? mr darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 77.18478460708549 
when i last saw her , she was not very promising 10.19537680484906 
she has two nieces of her own 5.770295748186111 
" " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he 19.11377249768613 
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr bingley , if she could 22.38017721464412 
yet , indeed , i am in earnest 6.91652881959991 
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 15.154481831776492 
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 27.025572274754353 
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister 26.51098487502628 
your sister i also watched 4.083349100504427 
i shall be back by dinner 5.033231850743899 
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions 15.99119268383466 
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 21.91031576546287 
my poor father how he must have felt it " " i never saw any one so shocked 17.079550809434917 
" what could become of mr bingley and jane " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs 18.826112192689454 
in the hall they parted 3.9293877231050427 
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor 43.19725909055429 
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life 23.012007786844443 
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam 7.290635045517327 
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard 31.658144592029778 
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer 16.031717769277055 
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable 8.998262038544997 
" i am all astonishment 4.193517757184348 
" " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks 15.26029716214396 
" " la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off 14.925991682259536 
not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves 14.81081847357548 
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support 18.77751414611374 
" " but upon my honour i do _not_ 8.038530248542575 
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings 61.8847231593335 
mr bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters 15.06788470433489 
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when 17.958974091848788 
" " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged 20.980368716559315 
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 25.15483638002432 
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme 70.59194145684395 
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 39.39063077724202 
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is 18.36793550633324 
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her 48.42631116250799 
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on 21.051757316048786 
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy 63.01043584399991 
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone 22.727025868422665 
while sir william was with them , mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road 101.63272922321337 
he is gone to my father already 6.280176888167555 
" " to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good 37.52634965423286 
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating 10.836686334301474 
he has heartily forgiven me now 4.979663744663237 
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with 33.3625098927394 
" " miss elizabeth bennet " repeated miss bingley 8.087172613338618 
" mr bingley followed his advice 5.052431236138606 
" " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth 18.040816010253383 
will you come and see me ? " " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire 17.908036825946937 
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds 30.857186218209407 
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia 28.946409813258672 
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ 10.989385509340368 
mrs bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual 8.776316200084615 
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected 12.127188421378943 
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? " " in the first place , " replied mr gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland 40.205244617905564 
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what 38.82011749053136 
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it 26.273942885093366 
" " no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me 18.98617482585077 
i am perfectly satisfied 2.9190480204961022 
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection 38.21179326537576 
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 21.849959165587492 
" chapter xviii 2.013939135823144 
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself 26.913556762020026 
" elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 7.955843424793343 
" in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 63.46825756602419 
" " how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , " you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate 32.22520136549592 
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit 51.87308637068195 
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve 21.342293043466565 
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you 11.977947020239945 
" " complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little 12.3746328862982 
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family 40.62193043578156 
we may compare our different opinions 4.85095930376669 
" " you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment 27.2603645502588 
mrs long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not 13.419533932669744 
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s 18.22114339913793 
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied 6.780833005117963 
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 8.205146034486075 
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world 19.983490949721187 
" yet why did he come ? " she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak 28.753807129528877 
" " i beg your pardon 5.104843058351757 
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them 11.27413414253996 
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration 23.74272334801039 
" " indeed i do not dare 6.413152628304547 
the visit was returned in due form 6.120341450314221 
" your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds 34.13445384873436 
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented 16.21629954052255 
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out 23.018234537643508 
the path just admitted three 3.9651268457294067 
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 26.892455996080997 
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 27.39839338595721 
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage 56.97825596840034 
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn 66.43819175944988 
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough 22.447221704010357 
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it 46.400705278654485 
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr darcy , and mr darcy only , entered the room 58.54540961839219 
" " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth 13.975413311741045 
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again 17.97808609326678 
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour 27.12283502014041 
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 24.118075419139306 
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 28.78877170369113 
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt 10.166100011947412 
the loo table , however , did not appear 7.956883428650623 
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity 20.908849919793905 
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 11.184859411748807 
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _that_ , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before 25.08620501644175 
" " i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly 12.972438591911997 
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves 12.090372523094366 
" and that , " said mrs reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him 23.248821480843805 
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s 19.834697839410165 
" " no , no 4.0928047432213885 
egerton , military library , whitehall 4.968790029415627 
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 7.977669610489889 
" in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet 35.88778257272324 
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements 9.999540616355912 
but it is all , all too late now 8.023077666010941 
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost 40.36574111986703 
but it is so strange " " yes _that_ is what makes it amusing 13.316313922925438 
" " miss bingley told me , " said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance 21.409586624430382 
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed 16.518893014310272 
" " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man 26.37666012529762 
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 22.960043839338493 
mrs bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces 39.309998687568736 
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many 29.513221554399642 
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship 16.58598128482299 
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time 37.99804117263474 
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments 21.89376688504729 
" mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last 35.41306874353664 
" " is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " no , indeed 27.051117815402495 
i know how much you dislike him 5.829420890507122 
" " this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not 28.390966160410745 
mrs bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 21.99796121940989 
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds 7.81622825772637 
" " if you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone 18.50377173122531 
" " i cannot believe it 5.149058754001844 
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own 21.004822550587996 
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky 16.710215999558763 
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 16.28290485677047 
lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room 21.213759617526076 
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible 54.198884613480175 
you have no compassion on my poor nerves 6.981895587121975 
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary 23.275658400016898 
" " that is as it happens 5.9833424850413595 
it is every way horrible " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence 12.261661677235256 
" then addressing her daughter , " oh my dear , dear jane , i am so happy i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night 30.756385384946434 
" oh " said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply 22.300175197005668 
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh 72.38570745046056 
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _nephew_ 9.092381687176402 
" " take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment 12.332414401453896 
by the author of " sense and sensibility 6.823891670689612 
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue 17.65085856541341 
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 19.09201664488477 
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 10.125299567287204 
i shall like it of all things 5.917330651748343

" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 34.95775075959474 
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 44.57657607862518 
when they were all in the drawing room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give 35.03548374758197 
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me 9.09591983048889 
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter 17.17515637104748 
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him 30.112931777317534 
you must not disappoint your father 5.140149375907388 
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 22.767721633260997 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine 21.083765448368997 
pray , how _violent was_ mr bingley ' s love ? " " i never saw a more promising inclination 19.315585928445586 
they are all for what they can get 6.831017378437627 
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off 23.32867206149316 
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love 76.21380675258527 
" " nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley 12.204940398270505

he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr darcy 68.57135724288209

never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 13.085143112783106 
" mrs bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 14.338563656975106 
" " of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is 51.76121537246305 
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more 17.229114634473515 
" " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again " " he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty 60.10724506332188 
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states 20.873916458289987 
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost 36.109170622422305 
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word 7.864920762041051 
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe 40.01255696677574 
it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable " " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these 23.018365934332383 
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune 42.674655697557135 
" with my mother up stairs 5.101275567442755 
in spite of having been at st 5.883931211879697 
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy 25.346710780027614 
it was over at last however 4.932604465745105 
" her father lifted up his eyes 5.896045954768566 
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire 20.913665589335025 
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon 7.957840014617424 
" " you may as well call it impertinence at once 9.73232951273137 
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again 12.013783122963774 
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away 13.195251244114068 
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome 19.040632568152557 
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 27.920083595663762 
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress 25.97938119595599 
the supposition did not pain her 5.311363021789484 
" " oh , yes 4.020058969535126 
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy 16.882152028672387 
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me 31.99945641025987 
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 34.236106965712565 
well , much good may it do them and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead 24.24523341657018 
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back 8.46260805280772 
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach 35.45072648758126 
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr bingley , was incomprehensible 47.51049840319441 
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 29.78760753415592 
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london 35.96357498472949 
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 80.97333520633603 
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light 40.05374379648244 
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 22.03111242472817 
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes 22.771172257813486 
miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt 12.18858562665022 
" elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ 23.27577556771005 
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment 39.26632141751309 
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head 19.158677449935677 
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 27.6468027233452 
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom 31.92384528575945 
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ? this will never do 37.151076210488924 
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 27.343225639040966 
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him 22.556130299174928 
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart 46.539168692906536 
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr philips ' s 23.30030822236973 
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened 8.760800115545136 
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 7.071695508418281 
and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach 19.461285495793497 
" mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer 18.348990758648448 
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies 30.161748290936742 
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared 53.98476060752023 
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head 20.209141965710092 
" mr wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family 27.035352909003574 
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you 45.23848636978865 
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind 39.44926456132463 
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much 37.960797782604985 
mr bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 51.91752080912752 
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever 26.223391724197448

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place 27.23415868480029

she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either 35.57223075542937 
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him , and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject 48.73645487609246 
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family 53.84029809871132 
" " did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 25.97172163461061

mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 30.65562209678908 
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring 54.005456600879 
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil 39.86740962355605

have you never happened to see her there ? " she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet 62.98041520783586 
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself 34.83137319848485 
" elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 16.961802470082365

he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend 34.999241618880944 
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease 19.123765132877253

" " it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas 15.427618798421339 
" " i do not mind his not talking to mrs long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza 26.305772939822962 
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me 9.031674000153265 
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm 40.76309169622762 
you must contrive to send somebody 4.90153037920246

" " my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious 9.12042865621481 
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 8.060199824544029 
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 20.008299852928715 
i speak nothing but the truth 5.107948523361343 
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 37.9659239881754 
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 86.42406541604153 
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend 72.76859706663768 
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet , and mrs hurst was observing their game 14.813288060461545 
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 21.234435787438827 
i will go directly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure 20.03722919310086 
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk 77.32403352298941 
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 37.26400557957584 
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly 22.811506532344715

at five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 21.17804643821091 
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it 28.64191208142747 
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 48.52693859650295 
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 47.872476151091085

i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 26.323766062317844

lady catherine , sir william , and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party 41.94210520144737

if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ' night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 88.43311247687333

" not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs bennet give up the point 20.80018992066858 
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as i am missed 39.579729429626056 
" fitzwilliam darcy 2.0444339260568047 
you supposed more than really existed 5.053406998767517 
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " i advise mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning 83.68685600430189 
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him 32.39781480138748 
this mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town 28.618446508613946 
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of 29.53263800467046 
do your sisters play and sing ? " " one of them does 12.016621378616591 
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 29.633684538271048 
" " you are over scrupulous surely 6.047738480043387 
" " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do 17.21331071769261 
a few days after this visit , mr bingley called again , and alone 13.242727534695877 
on the following monday , mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 26.61146130468875 
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage 30.34515286528218 
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen 11.405890382607822 
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood 60.597966121960916 
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased 33.65588074727765 
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 7.926212358018255 
i depend on you for that 4.860520453021526 
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland 36.311531884150185 
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes 20.2512156177264 
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together 66.36217987832981 
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph 10.092735804725342 
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him 33.5802201763047 
" " i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice 19.450552175292064 
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 101.48745184302221 
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it 13.569637543709256 
but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without 11.203250554618961 
but still he would be her husband 6.182870097247593 
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair 38.99044311679572 
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married 34.24079006303759 
" my dear father , i congratulate you 7.2144150771764055 
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road 42.78087233317468 
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther 101.04239471381666 
you do not look well 4.04511331706345 
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 32.79759746891103 
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister 32.32660324338528 
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 39.96207358968791 
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him 75.4884274003727 
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f 18.384486267473232 
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs 62.54961442960103 
" good gracious " cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened " " a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh 45.529869619232436 
" mr darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh 21.33027821371141 
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced 63.56873412355687 
mr bennet treated the matter differently 5.01116570486144 
" " lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home 32.109533972710494 
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her 52.48071399252163 
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then 35.30406704275082 
" " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 12.356630418893031 
" it is a long time , mr bingley , since you went away , " said mrs bennet 18.586362999064363 
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing 50.46085579342718 
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house 27.28066058820644 
you tear them to pieces 3.983598014751602 
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together 46.49824874254539 
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley 19.424663948162138

why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after 47.06867408114125 
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed 42.17524975321389 
" " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower 11.213942102754636 
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance 75.95052594283344 
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak 35.34700207446839

she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting 10.170806549396637 
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr collins 16.36874906666038 
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it 12.185334375206615

she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded 77.09482979606436 
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her 28.64207388522231

there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects 19.512549371104843 
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted 10.87236931679728 
her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 50.69697878611431

" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage 46.27430640682149

mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene 10.210342955254749

mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head 32.31678202642546

and to be kept back on _such_ a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 24.075948941619423 
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well 19.065133350675712 
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family 31.818766681955747

mr collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet 16.32709126477585 
mr collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably 29.161324624319988

for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions 54.94046515878918 
" elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself 27.122897678052855

these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not 26.418167937976612 
it originated in mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s 31.50915599656827 
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? " " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months 47.530598531916475

" is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly to put me on my guard ? can there be any other opinion on the subject ?

as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables 55.80217783044198

he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence 9.834863640339966

" " can i have the carriage ? " said jane 9.990661915270016 
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips ' s manners and politeness 16.923394343721164 
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 88.2965391202979 
lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern 113.11839839637484

his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by 33.81804068057511 
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 60.49064308614453 
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire 23.040255188887492 
lydia was exceedingly fond of him 4.920989562919517 
" oh my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " oh , lord i don ' t know 25.90229770658796 
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth 37.41271364329882 
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend 28.65508928509235 
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 38.01152800489996 
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement 8.971344297350742 
" " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them 31.919083272008884 
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due 78.29277963270754

" " i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 23.002274908230422 
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy 9.023609187831546 
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention 21.85198667450352 
" " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them " " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours 44.81088384901597 
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 25.001962618407497 
" " yes , very different 5.190507442376682 
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not 19.133048063127642

he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 6.7366877847194475 
" nothing that she could say , however , had any influence 10.900606581006532 
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 58.12489136720637 
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose 24.010917528893806 
_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse 14.026021489997348 
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him 17.676639184005204 
" and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case 17.785047021519564

she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham , and rejoiced in it 18.699192718627085 
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way 71.78028186592556 
" " you have said quite enough , madam 8.43359251869947 
" " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 28.51486448770531 
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room 140.79973411161515 
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it 23.788862917190745 
but of course she did not mention my name to you 9.883884712844086 
" " well , then supposing them to be in london 10.526144537999974 
lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr collins was to attend them , at the request of mr bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford 99.31869489918714 
" " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam 18.360491848999263 
i should infinitely prefer a book 4.7956291863204195 
" elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them 24.155974993577782 
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 21.413288978740695 
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed 11.248796353881904 
" " and my mother how is she ? how are you all ? " " my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken 29.921892768342286 
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed 55.33498145699547 
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 48.3724169401829 
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 22.97446376372244 
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes 26.289355490986797 
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is 51.750984875729806 
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves 21.311399846850605 
she shall hear my opinion 3.978380605607656 
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character 22.483338973057137 
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her 37.8907115262357 
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished 31.756270154879576 
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence 44.91614641073917 
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day 14.883864420173976 
" their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her 121.94611371690269 
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it 21.068306726225792 
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended 43.7522351989312 
have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 30.07806347057737 
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well 39.14035593742588 
" i am sorry it went off 6.057909198821572 
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 28.966222856620952 
" " i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think 12.220417162023404 
i will read it to you " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel 91.51639338908434 
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object 12.139069578849224 
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 24.604207597401384 
mrs bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 15.899337260415514 
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome 22.67056175570736 
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance 37.46333201143489 
a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect 14.037459699933704 
" without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 49.48825537883221 
" how near it may be to _mine_ , i cannot pretend to say 12.674958889933205 
mrs bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could 35.3344981487404 
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character 16.69735140951961 
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd 21.247700383610805 
the dejection was almost universal 3.837346787992012 
" " my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do 27.512700683741695 
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting 13.84176361352932 
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 17.65836006446256 
" the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 51.96078702515713 
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him 16.146515231002322 
" " you are uniformly charming " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 42.65534939002213 
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate 15.267284608914796 
elizabeth was delighted 2.017819608719269 
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts 40.28980474487759 
i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him 13.211424032091921 
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts 17.63853069577211 
but she is nothing to me now 6.2001815092470745 
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 11.383752800681057

do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley 16.1464288515616 
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 13.133209083272263 
" " mr darcy is not to be laughed at " cried elizabeth 11.814007158217224 
" consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ did 40.91997499763051 
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side 47.137805889070094 
" he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton 33.85597635645716 
" mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 28.4059606851649 
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love " " i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy 29.642876969265263 
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully 14.310272325089358 
what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses 17.723278583678685 
others of the party were now applied to 6.7375605572173844 
" as soon as ever mr bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " you will wait on him of course 24.305391865393762 
but my dear lydia , i don ' t at all like your going such a way off 16.86386710594583 
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance 10.851169941746356 
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ 34.64780215801089 
wickham passed all his youth there , you know 8.103180279364338 
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her 53.40897148935343 
" " i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 29.838512201909683 
mr collins was eloquent in her praise 5.8382971620698605 
the church _ought_ to have been my profession i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now 42.25538606311274 
i _must_ have employment and society 5.092765392851308 
but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it 15.17858715746036 
" darcy was fixed in astonishment 5.175593768922118 
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done 14.28549987067355 
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 23.91534851676152 
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 46.137172547037224 
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 11.177927186257577 
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy 17.824366389415182 
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 15.270861376430581 
this was agreed to , and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 28.89772489823572 
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed 17.223986356457665 
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 17.20007540034363 
do you often dance at st 5.116436421403714 
i am not equal to it 5.2080682326938135 
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 68.88776716099171 
" " miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , " despises cards 13.431630297134687 
" good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true ? oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all 55.257236117367036 
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 63.101663709519784 
; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 17.388261099592164 
" yours , c 3.057422916640716 
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery 33.686850599568295 
mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return 19.121753712891188 
" mr bennet made no answer 5.172897886081059 
" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 35.95540219984618 
i am very , very sorry 4.787806297869166 
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring 32.74187365272726 
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address 34.502135863375756 
" she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley 15.318691225987363 
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 28.654068231359904 
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill 13.66870752036383 
mrs bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again 26.494601566470216 
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next 18.066649830998667 
every thing nourishes what is strong already 6.082285187404411 
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech 14.510508448792029 
" your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; " and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr darcy 35.98766707016851 
on finding mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs bennet instantly answered , " oh dear yes certainly 84.60124823983257 
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this 11.47833829235499 
this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then 21.37655717674541 
" " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? " " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 70.58097982873323 
elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply 20.32612411599124 
mr darcy said very little , and mr hurst nothing at all 11.099531792571584 
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg tm license when you share it without charge with others 33.00876779028677 
" mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled 6.010397295285867 
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy ' s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page 39.846524545496564 
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 11.781256462064073 
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding 16.51433167515503 
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 55.27314119829786 
" " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " sometimes 16.41964262337894 
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter 7.05267226781258 
" " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother " because he does _not_ write with ease 25.017677436065217 
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring 19.640017808627054 
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 12.823015616364522 
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families 32.01782420194974 
" " mr darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling 12.20614064220404 
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail 12.886278669427968 
" " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 34.57991954923429 
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 42.93467690191277 
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon 11.13953029328447 
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut 18.756001429614738 
" " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation 21.369315407912033 
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance 40.86116928094812 
" " but i was embarrassed 4.953549408525394 
" you may well warn me against such an evil 8.638226936164978 
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 50.53100149720422 
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 22.227241625634928 
can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " no , my dear ; i think not 17.13879292746811 
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world 24.052392611514637 
" you look pale 3.1365218584260335 
to mrs gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers 15.733135777565673 
i really cannot _laugh_ at it 5.024030495782331 
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of 38.656162162748714 
" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment 15.980613717913846 
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature 59.973596273627265 
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle 15.736346015628042 
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement 52.17647490299972 
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ' s regiment , now quartered in the north 16.625363896368807 
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 28.207139546645298 
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation 59.13088787438089 
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 9.097033639153203 
your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ 23.567923892509576 
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not 13.054325832149646 
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor 19.04971442027195 
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane ' s introduction of him 109.62031155288095 
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere 24.51623536361227 
" mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain 18.09757262051469 
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice 13.050686583301275 
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing 39.400428781996624 
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask 22.664602275980826 
" " he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 33.445940338193466 
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins , who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests 63.21535019857809 
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced 11.224355970521817 
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing 37.87855585106486 
it would have been strange if they had 7.00659804748967 
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down 12.970594192328656 
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " _wished_ they might be happy 37.83494225823801 
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you 27.397249909930547 
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses 18.843528648587586 
i dearly love a laugh 4.037921245421282 
" he should be particularly happy at any time , c 9.657045940779804 
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 34.98454463447537 
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him 11.088772718414083 
very nonsensical to come at all why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy " " yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office 69.95531306971299 
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did 35.151192244156256 
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated time 33.31399261881593 
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment 22.844444361132535 
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter 54.857628424507105 
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 105.57460102614516 
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present 23.1300401033909 
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 9.463512968465258 
she had a sister married to a mr philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 37.50856797178256 
are you going much farther ? " " no , i should have turned in a moment 15.569827785002648 
mrs bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 68.65070786492302 
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character 7.995510645679702 
mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home 49.08093460088602 
" " i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder 14.150064147877154 
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion 16.39176534511288 
" " oh you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice 14.240633927323444 
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account 25.206709914682634 
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled 9.770030301149154 
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 24.24878591765628 
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 14.650971631529883 
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 25.396714834832764 
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception 20.236234923901918 
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement 27.64830052503977 
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg tm works 35.145880788485734 
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth 19.885876956170698 
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 13.94977891543487 
" mrs collins , you must send a servant with them 9.78961453318984 
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind 15.135015863077406 
" " but my father cannot 5.0315086775473725 
" charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 13.083125219790254 
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned 16.080925133118342 
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law 15.116186394937529 
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention 10.565577677270385 
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed 26.174926629021815 
yet he knew to the contrary himself 6.0714085097020165 
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with 71.60501734078139 
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 14.08665199983082 
" while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 34.61419949118334 
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr darcy 15.031076050586472 
" " but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs long has promised to introduce him 29.774303004124725 
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated 61.479871383875704 
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent 19.22389941338468 
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him 45.81903713418865 
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency 18.082752657223242 
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia 9.197067301131634 
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 74.32617050589296 
" " and men take care that they should 8.161673648147547 
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken 46.97482552077509 
" " miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with 28.263996724887612 
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed 21.868107130571396 
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you 41.94090454942568 
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children 13.011083283194065 
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest 29.72204600545237 
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her 11.2552896767015 
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs 60.857733397668476 
" " perhaps that is not possible for any one 8.803280365494553 
by the author of " sense and sensibility 6.823891670689612 
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere 30.280281764990338 
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters 30.251734222285545 
they were ignorant , idle , and vain 6.882516254176943 
he cannot know what mr darcy is 5.9406981556085094 
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts 48.004833236824915 
" but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year 61.97196240942484 
" this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them 12.157580117131468 
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing 37.765085001148755 
the children have been wanting me this half hour 7.863922480046315 
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 36.143756118070996 
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open 14.027518706870024 
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance 33.4738860244969 
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information 22.469658024326872 
" jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay 17.575694916014484 
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town 46.04101777830375 
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited 32.74849883700488 
" " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham 12.252663108900736 
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 44.46785199089636 
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you 21.710206114890067 
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible 39.66528981960687 
" " oh do not repeat what i then said 9.10553105481773 
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world 20.54152231633041 
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me 38.11403183010841 
she does not yet leave her dressing room 7.043077810133736 
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained 57.13694367995908 
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family 33.91419556238709 
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses 8.845053220947268 
" " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever 20.482545561702675 
the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father 43.57488982814315 
one does not know what to think 5.772890909404257 
it mortifies me 1.9197385576662869 
was not a man to be trusted 5.967801597555051 
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation 26.74990685183727 
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 72.07744910007678 
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself 45.857857338993576 
" " and have you answered the letter ? " said elizabeth 11.073174845455194 
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 48.22476934720307 
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line 28.22172712810722 
" " i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 57.913580471706226 
pray , what is your age ? " " with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 29.41923410916508 
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ' s regiment 10.97423124742321 
you are safe from me 4.173238813404553 
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 32.50679564036888 
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh no 13.461412062330117 
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest 50.48777634253933 
" this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas 15.318616926017143 
" mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good 34.712673987427465 
" and they are really to be married " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves 18.27441061932 
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 43.524935684868815

as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch 79.1772230593558

that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable 46.12563883403906

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 32.25271688518193 
he had never had the slightest suspicion 5.820734844941446 
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose 20.18052287641442 
by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 35.49203032462066 
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry 10.065716465153763 
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 21.34115375416327 
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 10.22694171207935 
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 17.765590245917465 
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility 47.281729672167096 
when mrs bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 29.041007981734452 
" can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated 12.429134850982853 
how much you must have gone through " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party 54.95992167302999

things are settled so oddly 3.96985218778613 
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 33.238546485636746 
every savage can dance 3.0841982728919732

well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone 25.490725372628628 
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing 125.25550882246083

" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry 96.5676615736729 
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again 21.875462444605468

the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence 37.58197243259269 
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own 51.5123820250339 
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain 34.40186531412511 
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed 24.942148303278966 
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 62.905388845045444 
" " i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth 9.197468040791176

she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers 42.164720923493874

gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection 38.854824891349836 
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind 10.911345776692192 
you refuse , then , to oblige me 7.107721893255835 
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain 59.233179664407004 
" mrs reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 18.20113556780125 
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females 39.49047153959189 
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke 31.614797826780315 
" " i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony 42.4970843999843

we must not make him desperate 4.992661669038958 
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted 4.103971928165861 
" " are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction 13.010985345697343 
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution 18.499895185537767 
" elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them 60.10588546613817 
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 27.02519088149706

after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " she smiled , but made no answer 59.26288984957353

he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible 40.619637983969604 
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 18.019829242162565 
" " except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate 13.255568746187885 
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence 14.147485708220573 
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr darcy could not have 55.10718054990738 
" " oh " said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i ' m the tallest 24.92390380372495 
" " well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents 68.45981971237644 
" " yes , madam , " said mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine 17.392370080129947 
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked 21.562291724253836 
it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 24.162626412692553 
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy 33.634171893136255 
mrs collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure 12.454133356121403 
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 31.361729045551773 
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain 15.98572902425449 
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer 22.309373836996983 
" " i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 61.144945508878415 
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again 18.733903749650583 
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification 17.15129004347298 
" mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer 30.41152265180976 
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish 49.567773419531115 
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her 63.08379653127308

mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me 16.399934079683778 
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 51.418791810391056 
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine 32.78368882872725

" " your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth 18.782808506310804 
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable 16.946356071800324

" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 8.539461483557455

but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane 29.967749703692338 
" " the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study 20.139203550756182

i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written 20.460411488728045 
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth 28.38110202819047 
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks 16.91774812092839 
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country 28.105638315469847 
" " you are mistaken 3.990597311001158 
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately 21.30797229370174 
" " their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget 26.295462478723522 
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind 86.9850863908841

" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 55.09836230901943

i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object 12.257598506042125 
he now wished it more than ever 5.880153679725631 
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present 37.15219104154058 
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , c 22.939530244900435

maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 15.967814654826169 
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer 51.11482969040856 
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 21.49765793085165 
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable 16.90672998426613 
he is perfectly amiable 3.0571100774862416 
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter " he made no answer 15.657784382699633 
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned 35.84164169690888 
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 57.57845672138318 
" while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough 17.09845794231141 
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you 31.910737765709683 
my temper i dare not vouch for 6.0464441290292505

" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 48.59424914132289 
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned 56.66055686154926

the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week ; and even mr darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 43.733419382973665 
i knew you would be wishing me joy 6.940180124123955 
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side 25.37078094649298 
" charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family 71.37296743865225 
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your ' s_ seems to have been 22.610145051011745 
" " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 40.986896589597045 
we seem to have been designed for each other 7.909353069390143 
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet 19.988491824689778 
i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter 28.12176807632859 
we neither of us perform to strangers 6.023663317020969 
people do not die of little trifling colds 7.412226432721255 
" there , mrs bennet 4.230885128391406 
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking 22.382400439291867 
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 7.973896287245246 
" what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? " not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it 66.22378804872119 
" where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door 14.948844145705783 
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 37.476365467657594 
believe her to be deceived by all means 7.225524273827432 
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction 11.721048811990395 
" " if i were as rich as mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was 30.388964454989434 
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 17.75977051521017 
" " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour 51.534259172982935 
miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice 32.168601314975675 
" " yes , very well 5.125296516743773 
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away 30.25048750240883 
james ' s ? " " never , sir 7.999791090629106 
" catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london 47.37678537697341 
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former 33.189661097850866 
" " are you quite sure , ma ' am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane 19.840426913930298 
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time 19.50956277619521 
" " oh if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 33.306519573796734 
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself 18.90817575926542 
i shall now know how to act 6.216641189303926 
_that_ is all to be forgot 4.873087488576944 
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled 13.034473992445273 
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 15.68280911714004 
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were 21.335333417230732 
" " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " yes 17.038520230883343 
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited 63.70976822146521 
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement 37.24200629029101 
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence 28.42654626261091 
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age 18.011947149082815 
" " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said mrs gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face 29.20436314886462 
how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful 16.058212750871235 
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount 49.97327633345854 
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 40.98804501299485 
" " i wish it may 4.935967747545063 
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 25.309194729078996 
" " yes ; but he seemed to like his second better 11.573079966320698 
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 14.103043810567502 
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire 97.73511741273543 
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend 51.26110034724241 
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart 60.63260203520552 
how he lived i know not 5.078258873840975 
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit 13.39308765989686 
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected 18.607216374577362 
i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better 34.379786225597 
i never was 1.906392739287784 
" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside , " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable 23.672052586955754 
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it 21.2461684635469 
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to 21.083690884963367 
" his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative 36.01148984997849 
but i suppose you had no opportunity 5.972846374448087 
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view 29.14248622080472 
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir 11.0739479933244 
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law 37.449674504607565 
her own thoughts were employing her 4.901843720825298 
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read 13.762551620526324 
he begged pardon for having displeased her 5.976087476558028 
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away 19.617037490640048 
" or in other words , you are determined to have him 11.290926679251 
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better 19.946581339933996 
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 15.118249158725158 
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 43.762604291129556

but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment 88.61730553350564 
james ' s 1.9536469320821352 
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters 24.327895158064027 
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield 13.1791642701543 
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure 46.50184673021842 
but that is one great difference between us 6.98241232558381 
" " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire 50.39733129918957 
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 12.191632596921647 
miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it 9.054676230876783 
you have employed your time much better 6.063940784506638 
" and this is always the way with him , " she added 12.046186984708866 
mrs gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder 18.950331404937355 
miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings 30.72165206192741 
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 25.78579429024289 
now what have you to say ? " " only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 31.292284308873647 
no thanks to his gallantry for that 6.059128833352967 
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 29.308846998098407 
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london 13.049931952292038 
there is one point , on which i want your advice 9.765263595409174 
mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 54.43243111067118 
_i_ shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you 11.796130695374876 
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it 12.897031017251091 
i know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched up business , at the expence of your father and uncles 27.74356962745857 
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country 44.47397229568004 
" no one made any reply 4.918455341557219 
it amazes me , i confess ; for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction 18.91581423113307 
i described , and enforced them earnestly 5.970345234424842

but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out 17.941873749281207 
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 26.34708867190612 
_i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples 26.331469045350783 
they found mr bennet still up 5.096176130867143 
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path 16.97584644742755 
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 22.335027774558146 
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 13.939165335777444 
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask 30.998122039757746 
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet ' s ill humour or ill health 14.3360225942216 
my sisters may write to _me_ 5.21738356638672 
" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 28.633643611586088 
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous 45.231568914801265 
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her 27.58096461471454 
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare 9.855206029151201 
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 40.65522989709402 
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body 11.129737182300927 
" mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters 21.139087630946296

i was ready to die of laughter 6.156147681802806 
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 19.22055947782569 
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given 38.96081849622076 
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable 12.901563533865925 
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings 50.45851316790928 
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit 45.0939863002043 
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us 15.969195028166817 
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 17.936014483400918 
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away 32.76913679233641 
their fortune on both sides is splendid 6.189621555550544 
if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it 10.356291291604014 
perhaps he thought her too young 5.332052279790791 
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false 27.351655926306304 
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland 37.15403681884008 
" " good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow 11.134868968527785 
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely 16.065661668389584 
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same 31.701172883659233 
" " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune 22.341459119096452 
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street 29.70209618894596 
" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister 95.13766171547923 
his reception however was of the most flattering kind 8.338964132507487 
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 15.139288589177513

" " you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us 31.97902777367702 
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing 16.400784276763545 
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over ruled , as i always am 23.07830354472423

" " is my father in town ? " " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word 20.617684236092348 
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 74.95092523184717 
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 58.63244451772227 
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 69.1800704641674 
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself 16.66197725184194 
one must speak a little , you know 7.1513726598124245 
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " by all means , " cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of 140.17536355542617 
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room 34.746926008622076 
pride and prejudice : a novel 4.9107841215256 
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 57.183754790460206

elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 16.686583577019995 
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 29.18264994924041 
not all that mrs bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley 32.554165583362106 
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr wickham 56.41114259170492 
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going 45.72643773120212

_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property 48.3814016296014

between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard 13.509691792936964 
his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 43.574510454143436

the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 54.11305576556036 
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself 5.304633098754183

but these things happen so often a young man , such as you describe mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent 48.96853232111068 
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing 40.88129112118299 
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth 11.070421150395852 
sir william had been delighted with him 5.972124746602831

when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication 20.20605598997396 
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment 50.515896075076334 
my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it 44.36005469281931 
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled 24.083117103129187 
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 67.21489393661592

he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn 22.428166219719348 
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 31.1014778351038 
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it 26.378111167246182 
" " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage 46.82665228103479 
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post 59.08961549428391 
" " no , nothing at all 6.016506767860726 
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london 102.69927607622395 
let wickham be _your_ man 4.129098246888801 
he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning 25.409247713745323 
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day 55.595976106457314 
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was 50.7268554433201 
when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted 54.47285659373788 
you mentioned _two_ instances 3.1072926390455695 
" " i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas 14.477936051814279 
but , alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question 74.82352174255601 
" mr wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh 38.16295708491805 
the envelope itself was likewise full 4.857555097515525

to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house 38.863049956319834 
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 9.95049872951565 
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 36.96989789273731 
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? _she_ will not be able to help calling 16.157462934298017 
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did 44.22827207890777 
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side 74.36676959344392 
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else 13.32039424033341 
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great 9.28798824442394 
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public 32.049088570401274 
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic 11.733764110095919 
my dear , dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet " her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under 45.74753342809167 
poor jane i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately 19.7920503339026 
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table 39.07461756451601 
" " sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs bennet , alarmed 14.263703592540324 
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable 11.058123436507195 
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude 12.35394681605088 
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b 9.466345756299026 
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission so much the better 40.978699772113046 
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 27.677196799053267 
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom 28.229036305868497 
" " but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day 18.45976412791718 
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country 13.731396989180459 
" " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion 27.679302210966178 
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london 29.212567386015692 
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 9.248104013296135 
why was he to be the judge ? " " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy 67.0496819183424 
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 25.020814876221507 
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible 37.327834909636074 
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it 31.06987175042482 
her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary 53.11304810895369 
so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood 21.709409049689043 
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged 37.19112217367365 
" " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence 38.2999092988745 
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications 19.793183864455248 
i know it cannot be long 4.931887198582006 
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me 11.102229244843695 
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 48.09908731542323 
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long 13.53055915616247 
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them 29.15834579767905 
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last 33.97961889991512 
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments 22.79416200754429 
" " it is _not_ mr bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life 28.0952268479201 
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal 12.10421669631603

you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 8.223290793287562 
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy 14.422272284326455 
" " that is very true , " said elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before 19.007627972841604 
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation 62.822566948336885 
elizabeth was in agonies 3.0046510116102625 
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 28.01977792857281 
i always had a value for him 5.927787838888767 
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice 41.7458044352038 
" " upon my word well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know 27.16074297652455 
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying 6.877958231270276 
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to morrow 22.370092499752577 
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 34.70101789083968 
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 56.69946273262986 
" " is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 67.46909609551034 
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 75.34027241212605 
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard 26.51385429798719 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly 6.83353526393635 
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 10.944863440000736 
" " another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you 23.07033461884876 
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it 51.00013517837509 
" " some time or other he _will_ be but it shall not be by _me_ 15.049568734562081 
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham 41.54136936888459 
arguments are too much like disputes 4.962267999546097 
" " i can easily believe it 6.070469391852826 
" there is nothing the matter with me 6.992508860954418 
" " who do you mean , my dear ? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her 39.73165536315672 
yes , she will do for him very well 8.402521870835914 
the day passed much as the day before had done 8.828819871737755 
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place 11.829573611335896 
if this be the case , he deserves you 8.065614869755072 
you blamed me for coming ? " " no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise 15.235117665065244 
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man 12.12977693698408 
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other 46.039969994347274 
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once 14.815237826169843 
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year , and very likely more ' tis as good as a lord and a special licence 35.40806762022976 
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing 12.094070274549768 
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt 22.689903576962692 
the first part of mrs gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 22.173191347441325 
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself 24.40195328504985 
" they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " come , mr wickham , we are brother and sister , you know 60.25760477938488 
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy ' s 15.409899136325944 
i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name 11.179492242694783 
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 20.34713950749823 
" " oh your uncle he keeps a man servant , does he ? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things 25.406477146944063 
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 54.591538663001046 
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face 19.857715791156842 
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london 13.423509939542257

you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him 14.8693752005187 
" " may i ask to what these questions tend ? " " merely to the illustration of _your_ character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity 30.17390547421029 
if elizabeth , when mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 31.67143585289741 
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way 24.507302978648294 
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them 45.65871053779358 
what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing 12.029437325867706 
" your examination of mr darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley ; " and pray what is the result ? " " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect 38.197765087757375 
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins , and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy 20.319983391238136 
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr wickham and the officers , mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin 61.410109904952975 
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him 8.9511560025503 
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room 25.219369262810012 
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 20.851683912086482 
" before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 35.8183392441243 
" " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe 12.46214033682216 
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 12.940583262413691 
in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations 23.945185399760387 
" she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door 39.49659834160899 
" and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma ' am , do not go 25.721596268054228 
as long as she stays there , it is all very well 11.522879235172521 
pride and prejudice : a novel 4.9107841215256 
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy 15.680136870817138 
mrs bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph 16.02013833443083 
it is done , however , and it was done for the best 12.087635543036198 
" " no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event 66.95247967734046 
but our visitor was very obstinate 5.084535995952875 
" " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy ? " " indeed i am 16.869195970189697 
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority 39.807069918336346 
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 36.614986434602095 
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 11.802226768169666 
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this 27.61185070647317 
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad 18.00656232644674 
" " speak to lizzy about it yourself 6.787239200951057 
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card 32.56528494832374 
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness 21.180118320368962 
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company 37.866543181793816 
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost 23.539749661927946 
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 49.14841557202798 
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it 19.549167094961124 
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 12.885957901876026 
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives 25.913620504743854 
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night 15.859639538697252 
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected 30.22295213398108 
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 20.4594116379644 
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world 37.900135745529276 
" " how can you contrive to write so even ? " he was silent 13.638844265951969 
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 9.17443984412064 
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted 49.30966594663828 
i know not what to think 4.826877365760478 
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 17.75651779105383 
but the case is this 3.9118953642825405 
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever 37.25706471382583 
" " mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? " " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton 23.932992805994953 
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat 12.05436041841723 
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 23.611898347630692 
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections 10.11066664705055 
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where 27.92555826067586 
but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself 49.490362998209626 
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day 24.28587387235998 
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 17.767985870628735 
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 40.54138508443214 
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value " she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits 37.41022162068668 
we passed each other several times 4.845738070952135 
" " _that_ you certainly shall 4.888400057422295 
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants 21.908714250335414 
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant 20.623261953789967 
he added , that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon 22.813892909296868 
you know my sentiments 3.038774272340266 
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together 22.107359480046576 
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness 19.27640799367992 
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse 7.2141830498452535 
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy 19.196056645407 
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention 18.053860719902723 
london : printed for t 3.9122213862291892 
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings 17.65413777702665 
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion 12.89568217288162 
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place 16.8279305350927 
there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter , which promises well 14.390326800595266 
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections 13.220805590057761 
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done 18.61979199402363 
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 46.93931125142573 
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves 27.99879948996789 
" " we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit 27.415104388661526 
" " and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 25.785311576118087 
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 14.351634417504895 
" " do let us have a little music , " cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share 24.28980782542726 
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins 21.677560467638767 
" " yes , she did 4.929850136352122 
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 55.69703052861031 
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write 114.08598678439576 
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 10.871515155323491 
" " it is no such thing 6.019420841459245 
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford 18.264597522028165 
it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 18.189105510058248 
you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage 45.44261089407495 
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red 10.062882234162924 
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 103.34228684353566 
" " which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men 65.47789606368359 
you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt 42.812593346187406 
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life 18.041497959776112 
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette 10.864258187273537 
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home 36.30668519838153 
as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to 43.365482261663544 
you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule 18.488150598171817 
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 78.54005778862283 
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 82.0230934852761

in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction 28.870509301122063 
" " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 23.51918642108202 
" the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs bennet ' s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 53.33648572437463 
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money 14.231482683890066 
" " well , then , you need not be under any alarm 12.663382465686473 
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders 14.822978551278803 
" " thank you but i always mend my own 8.942800688264992

she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 57.717430383554095

" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds 48.91271668206725

while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible 46.396913020721904

" elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 51.8182138204749

miss darcy , the daughter of mr darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 25.423931555466634 
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay 29.772371313966072 
" she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room 49.195055912227424 
" and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing 55.89316965558568 
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object 11.058989326183333 
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard 57.58374392178064 
" " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr bingley to _her_ 21.361727034881156 
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 70.66744205844624

but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice 73.65121846777852 
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself 56.315959697883436

elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them 81.89612360438693

she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 28.666040911155825

their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them 37.63468886177674 
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage 107.87948018570926

she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning ? mr collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him 58.69925606582053

but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished 77.7283975714978 
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms 23.11092303759724

mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have " " yes , " thought elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once 42.79041917109093 
" about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand 33.775572210452324 
" " ah sir , i do indeed 7.055978470079454 
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small 48.03836474760628 
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair 10.84998709718021 
" and she rose as she spoke 6.135159531681197 
" " i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen 42.572484781823064 
" " heaven forbid _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil 28.69858510908757 
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr bennet , " and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 26.155877954730176 
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 16.241561063651442 
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance 25.197091284983376 
" and pray may i ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials 63.310232116681966 
" " and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? " " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 28.681365954291927 
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise 16.067594312033783 
but she is too much like her brother , very , very proud 11.633153201007145 
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day 80.8933668129146 
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement 12.977397689406292 
a person may be proud without being vain 6.901814071338103 
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable 31.873682191356117 
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him 14.488862274314677 
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary 8.945361243460772 
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling , selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say 48.88970003477602

but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king 16.30352778788246 
besides , there was truth in his looks 6.8988053166890095

" " you must not blame my aunt 7.17508380076485 
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 83.6545777720924 
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed 35.48211874644424 
mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed 11.952392000103522 
" " you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 13.210028669457653

she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her 14.244971081521212 
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle 25.907381670997466 
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 52.49353936207909 
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? heaven and earth of what are you thinking ? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? " " you can _now_ have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered 67.41351043581095 
" " perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers 29.9340576805107 
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all 48.281253519244366

if i wished to think slightingly of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however 20.369840346379902 
" " whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes 32.58246198647086 
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 39.489437035796925 
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied 36.03877544622672 
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 22.54410859099743

" elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately 9.18855055066314 
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished 35.07619825920939 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could 16.473555807672167 
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ? you are very ill 26.64248262420926 
" " no " said darcy , " i have made no such pretension 12.923265228540712 
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on 22.22609801883268

" how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty i must call it 43.76127571149295

after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 25.801574352730395 
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 67.17051814009001 
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion 16.247579826507994 
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 52.47413133586427

the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed 17.902288908618914 
what shall we do with him ? lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way 26.512036160138077 
" " money my uncle " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? " " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone 51.31699712578672 
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 61.583031939269546 
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 44.13235606005983 
i thought i should have died 5.208347227718553 
" " we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago 37.86418761529991 
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them 39.295425784371346 
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining 15.056931832598792 
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain 20.07839230254166 
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried 11.143501259499542 
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself 16.252531052871774 
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself 19.148194108268626 
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach 22.547614652979874 
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty 53.41963974602769 
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " i hope not 15.102414351227827 
" and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house 15.375786430321247 
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance 25.898171055545006 
" " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows 10.033693167208693 
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look 64.69045175555591 
they will ruin your happiness 4.037693142800405 
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information 22.624161683659878 
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them 37.704070160315105 
" this will not do , " said elizabeth 8.18176090627421 
" " i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want 14.184167294513795

amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 56.23310053648848 
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these 8.843514526856112 
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter 46.00802165609882 
on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former 85.67470257897227 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness 21.4398507804153

" " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness 40.10984239614681 
at that moment , she cared for no other 7.993358150178006 
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason 27.094558796677127 
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought 20.660475339931466 
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again 21.321415579821696 
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 37.17631913130204 
don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side 29.790360955952465 
" " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it 14.48443045353024 
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness 30.2192171320183 
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst ' s gown " here she was interrupted again 15.985442251942404 
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress 37.732919823619866 
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever 28.170729704543206 
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 6.982444203511315 
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected 18.88487199566445 
she is not such a simpleton 4.82458738369914 
" wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right 78.02265378731906 
" " gracechurch street , monday , august 2 7.93592153005652 
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure 60.941377933684876 
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her 11.937156285051898 
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear 39.05589348207282 
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference 46.0693455580618 
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it 37.40460379297439 
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go 47.268084895721174 
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more 31.70325702584181 
indeed , mr darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear 54.43905127715523 
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight 26.14233754202303 
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 31.11668377692721 
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece 19.95446550853055 
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better 15.031555056651692 
" " you are severe on us 6.291138860973895 
one ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be 44.38746473829527 
but with _me_ , it is not so 7.451837782737663 
" " kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill 18.681252674151295 
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all 17.728220360233692 
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street , for the town of in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 71.7204682021552 
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly 31.404767855823696 
how mr darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell 9.883972905962022 
" " indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother 17.35870574900329 
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall i call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough 33.95525360891893 
my aunt told me so herself on saturday 7.183510436621071 
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house 16.737890641357588 
" " i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do 18.151847704914037 
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 8.96090350966537 
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power 29.55673472305195 
" " oh " cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 16.585545447290947 
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 19.51221525851614 
they had frequently been staying with her in town 7.6396595670807805 
" mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 36.82049443671062 
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us 9.165955600566134 
mrs bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr bingley must be down again in the summer 17.41814594915427 
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense 19.124417484853797 
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 71.44378447576602 
this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no , no , you shall not deceive me 14.763472539681285 
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away 24.65062070772091 
" mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way 52.5638292414169 
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 19.842701818744647 
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again 33.02504862855363 
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear 17.428110679710002 
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns 12.887100229097717 
" " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? does he know his real character ? " " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did 38.90145210636307 
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years 23.966631023275024 
" " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament 36.35725792093538 
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time 10.041673444566475 
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men 53.5785631134648 
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 41.06814542363503 
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 63.1704675157078 
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 62.6655407900289 
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects 10.646219765809015 
" " i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly 49.611338830654944 
" " i had much rather go in the coach 9.401101356015074 
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr and mrs collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too 96.85139936067803 
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior 25.825432978707365 
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him 41.83326699942521 
how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope 22.953868713590463 
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined 38.99779011153541 
" " if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it 15.035097372352638 
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement 27.209961514314028 
" sir william only smiled 3.973930151860349 
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called 28.08438699448861 
" " let me be rightly understood 6.038094891165157 
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far 14.61181293779368 
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging 25.8693246378619 
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye 23.423395687664268 
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months 27.749240897305743 
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr collins too why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? " " i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr bennet 53.820029641141566 
jane was not happy 2.9856850296384483 
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you 19.70743416330081 
" " no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical 30.592987843936868 
" " i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him 23.3293174991012 
he was well , but so much engaged with mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him 17.321739729956786 
but _now_ we may be silent 4.854578540572867 
" but mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters 69.4396524698115 
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 22.277017224915166 
" chapter xxi 2.013939135823144 
" " did not you ? _i_ did for you 9.184559095454512 
" she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house 25.557910549303816 
but you have chosen your fault well 6.1655948222153425 
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 12.970632483935956 
the next was in these words 5.029659458858964 
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty 82.06481452191143 
" " _you_ go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it 40.2756452270593 
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce 10.025533050175945 
" elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 45.92412829570143 
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair 37.24957436732755 
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 16.945044179671275 
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch 19.05010374680327 
you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 19.731517360635266 
" " yes , " replied wickham ; " his estate there is a noble one 14.63149628763437 
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 18.544512943997766 
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family 31.001825882798443 
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 48.09267994310971 
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen 27.841705887076166 
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women 38.16800588229224 
he has more to give 4.101920800530301 
" _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it 14.193292528620296 
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly 73.82776883444754 
but you do not know _all_ 5.31313601549128 
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off 14.910826849353919 
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? " " yes , i have had a letter from him by express 72.28248162021214 
" " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things 29.377782561878096 
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more 13.275200186083186 
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 40.92305708346222

" " and what arts did he use to separate them ? " " he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling 28.674418466226903 
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal 41.407378896618134 
" on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley 60.77136948389881

she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 42.18638049267792 
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer 67.62472474859281

" " is that his design in settling here ? " " design nonsense , how can you talk so but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 47.1925772639396

the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity 49.09142084814302 
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 49.257509810571875

he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions 66.21152100929336

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed 56.029255262948716 
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived 13.161465088329816

yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over 23.011653299347326 
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here 114.90516422803388 
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner , though unknown 65.303332535742 
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself 34.28343984997333 
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day 17.069481915777228

other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons 14.050843290749414 
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not 31.724136777448663 
mr darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her 7.860665345097828 
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week 41.136864371370066 
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings 13.493315265205535 
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 54.748525862690414

" as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ; her _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged 50.713620437916774 
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 37.060892933979076

" " my dear jane " exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good 13.053807902590817 
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse 42.528269262433106 
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 15.262450940420477 
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character 8.979496284405839 
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go 22.968079913091394 
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 44.63299548436318 
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says 22.64185834710336 
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all 33.99340908041053 
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased 14.09428140262793 
" " and what did she say ? " " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well 26.28700632866548 
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance 7.921910173959342 
intending to trace their route 4.006461611922284 
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister 45.50491215119675 
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature 12.455298020311714 
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia " she cried 14.475466697301638 
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry 103.70271293917585 
it was an animating subject , and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match 19.518196842212845 
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages 20.019083226467725 
i always said it must be so , at last 9.02757811028825 
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress 42.133297512962656 
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste 19.593304931606276 
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer 14.460012220460014 
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed 16.430927518446794 
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 42.674364411251226 
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention 15.608643690375148 
" " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 21.638360698196905

respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown 20.256089213103316 
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him 42.8839514159141 
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him 13.23961045001041 
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure 27.523461685344238 
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view 21.20081208833889 
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " his misfortunes " repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed 35.17775072582692

" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend 11.206174751517297 
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again 24.871323134255704 
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr bingley 18.24281904475908 
" " i am not one and twenty 7.205453341843778 
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself 46.695910524600485 
clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish 12.334804631661836 
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 35.241948056629624 
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street 55.9315767420138 
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me 61.02863861859464 
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family 45.359848193711784 
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other 31.339364121070854 
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation 53.6311540361413 
but i will not repine 4.164054677466307 
a great deal more passed at the other table 8.330300897620988 
it was all pride and insolence 4.915504160719862 
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me 8.656695740728507 
oh had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much 23.91129255973286 
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other 17.41762985561519 
" " if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair 54.94097392758131 
stay , stay , i will go myself 6.9481010195205215 
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 14.126631948531221 
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband 18.730408416960703 
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 31.2314533384781 
" " i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 9.267938137039708 
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste 24.54606731107375 
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites 68.91050489068576 
is it true ? " elizabeth replied that it was 8.96947005587769 
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share 27.821864487248114

" " he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam 15.683887252445446 
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family 9.239873786875508 
such very superior dancing is not often seen 7.077493691250465 
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 15.95558815722723 
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 9.073797060268591 
" " i do not think we were speaking at all 10.29975520705914 
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 22.46569663804805 
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more 14.963686446425251 
in a few minutes , mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you 26.642264017775272 
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters 40.00439347225009 
elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her 7.0543908478722885 
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible 23.031641169082466 
" in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 34.36065077271459 
all was joy and kindness 3.986547158054581 
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous 25.762119002566273 
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 33.67944120599717 
" " i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character 20.304376874581553 
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting 23.001288765457108 
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what 16.03067179286099 
" " that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly 27.43297146009651 
" " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully 14.234311326091225 
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end " in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 59.80340490796705 
" elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case 16.036234332733724 
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them 13.055223483299269 
" what is mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear 39.79586051184759 
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations 33.47483472783585 
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane ' s 23.175222172326613 
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 48.17971191598982 
you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so 24.940751320293828 
" yes if darcy does not put it off again 8.875713175243119 
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one 35.66248414149378 
" do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; " that is rather singular 16.01848875077055 
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham 15.091268527963363 
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 11.520790915155672 
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express 22.979717577276805 
she certainly did not hate him 5.0794921243561175 
i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 44.06990429097298 
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? " " no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject 31.18947336736085 
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word 28.40718258991404 
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity 13.69261664334833 
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all 45.14700643258388 
" " beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing 29.868211796270362 
let her go then 2.979332839599811 
you know not what you are about 5.913964158082734

with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal 39.07346847463295 
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison 73.84801939777489 
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor 8.849986504891321 
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 51.03492631053504 
" " i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy ; " grieved shocked 13.758447900383784 
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance 54.2509439603666 
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 28.45129914831627 
wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 55.64718460292137 
" " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now 18.562398560054067

it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be 22.248420693475257 
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr darcy looked up 16.0874006919367 
but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day 16.257199830379964 
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 26.837524546203294

" " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum 57.41239623168251 
" " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books 17.38717739917511 
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character 25.048440298390688 
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject 11.801934788579567 
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 46.072616169976165

" " i am sick of mr bingley , " cried his wife 12.230686927106595 
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once 12.023792283828737 
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything 35.579770060087235

what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening 44.011919415021815

mr bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase 66.414138579771 
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former 29.50796220416174 
mrs bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 60.08586611261939 
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through 34.16296851194586 
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice 34.39905751722183 
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ? they must be a great loss to _your_ family 48.97302216413647 
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham 39.39542461393413 
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed 17.06782499156969 
yours ever , " caroline bingley 5.074351790739198 
it is mr wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army 33.420620549135826 
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded 19.27033775875775 
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it 61.126754757832764 
" " if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy 25.929218916880952 
by the author of " sense and sensibility 6.823891670689612 
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 25.68592518711355 
" " it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ 13.492430542241404 
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 11.067947013658337 
the moral will be perfectly fair 5.108354897071618 
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her 21.601504428190264 
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit 38.95318004558984 
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday 44.141902521595945 
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man 32.49912631572568 
" darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 20.98046605556632 
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes 64.28359075701839 
" as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth 45.80252682894489 
" " perfectly so i thank you 5.941335961293953 
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs collins 10.143795164163478 
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies 8.011290879122926 
" " my dear sir , " replied mr collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence 40.62814521688361 
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him 15.02553706426242 
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 20.11109189984839 
i wonder what he can be doing there 6.885464867724207 
there is nothing he would not do for her 7.760150541615114 
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away 47.747810724316004 
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 11.428216346169991 
lady catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable 19.07451021466473 
if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him 12.826330004207751 
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable 5.983570691609989 
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend 13.928681404088064 
" the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days 13.053652967076308 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself 45.835461379916886 
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 10.185671928849477 
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin 41.917717007536226 
' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time 19.712771866342475 
mr darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 14.51123964972618 
could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " " oh , yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt 32.17310978823896 
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in 6.092537991524832 
" " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 75.30114067857417 
" ' tis too much " she added , " by far too much 12.777603914751428 
" " la " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before 19.623682502377484 
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please 18.550883579550316 
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 28.579985445173318 
" " and i certainly _never_ shall give it 8.19299207943938 
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her 25.617161200106462 
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him 35.96717682203305 
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp 99.4887010241318 
transcriber ' s note : spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book 19.068350186211745 
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry 28.878049234193842 
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day 21.790614346531783 
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time 34.504335455224805 
" lizzy , you must not do so 7.237511299390541 
" mr darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter 11.436924221791992 
" " mr darcy " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement 10.010668339092224 
he was angry 2.0979143853993065 
no one but mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home 36.59028259114347 
i wish i could see her 5.100179765776136 
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent 46.39947537110968 
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right 48.54445439271732 
my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 47.83699990510807 
let us hope for better things 5.036466814857972 
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day 62.508917233243245 
it was kindly meant 3.00035204560504 
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too 10.86745648608461 
he was full of joy and attention 5.894754584388207 
on both sides it was only assertion 6.023021993078171 
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it 27.794891746048837 
mr wickham began the subject himself 4.916208881594515 
kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed 7.092292437500957 
i will speak to her about it myself directly 8.199621317488921 
" " oh certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with 28.722323170528295 
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 11.808673947919122 
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important 29.277414957182657 
good girl it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard 21.110584194057317 
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 32.55042886672602 
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it 10.147246779529674 
but i must write no more 4.858469802808104 
you are lucky in having such a master 6.941752079967004 
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry 23.598736357433463 
his words seemed to imply it 5.023677477523025 
" " you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy 27.108653950312092 
but enough of this 2.889829240186004 
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome 18.49923398861972 
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it 58.35792421005907 
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " yes , and i had heard it before 115.17057676768547 
they walked on , without knowing in what direction 7.942463744404265 
" mr gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 40.08015785765464 
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent 42.27121553685925 
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 7.330971161868631 
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon 25.389587928245387 
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided 12.567095788546276 
at present we have nothing to guide us 6.921512408754306 
it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother , as well as of her ' s 15.159209722237545 
" " oh where , where is my uncle ? " cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared 57.16222623290989 
" " i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley ' s conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery 45.20912525312771 
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 46.339862059043945 
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on 22.081510284880142 
" " undoubtedly 1.968826148164862 
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours 11.280567093997007 
" miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere 21.26634072811904 
if , indeed , it should be so but i dare not hope it 12.669456910358393 
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 5.853253374698019 
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him 24.52560419492972 
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 35.02727327764951 
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? " said she 11.000985242653984 
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long 33.433866220729364 
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 61.51909121465176 
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival " " i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 75.9400766389668 
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs long 14.236045050711656 
darcy said nothing at all 3.9893176888453525 
on saturday he came again 3.9486216491614807 
" " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model 23.208237770320384 
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks 10.899084853883293 
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ 28.98302130369349 
" " i should like it beyond any thing " said her mother 12.053755196982328 
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion 19.64757987821361 
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 33.402074285918225 
there was no arguing upon such a project 7.199297210678488 
he cannot afford it 2.9071406113425255 
" of what are you talking ? " " of mr collins and lizzy 13.29188180333966 
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all 27.23609928540952

her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh 52.92734641823467

it was dated from rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows : " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you 57.53323281133591 
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 9.703301154207534 
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 56.627669135642755 
where shall you change horses ? oh bromley , of course 10.418430768344583 
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful 30.924364439080495 
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance 11.799182764207048 
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself 16.382260668722942 
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year 26.047427754879816 
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy 57.847718704731285 
" " my dear , you flatter me 7.149200821369617 
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial 6.807439027905726 
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit 36.688682962976365 
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed " said mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own 29.85211554207147 
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 25.105066243093948 
" " but consider your daughters 5.150465097710621 
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley 7.911434549681535 
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 22.672163040513215 
" it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane 15.229711083136241 
" " no more have i , " said mr bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 27.835671097111227 
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once 57.14043901305045 
mr gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education 20.186526888375084 
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley 62.86203941561082 
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections 45.459942915279434 
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 21.769430960440438

his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again 36.447307148481016 
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer 30.09892735610524 
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn 6.013739132224799 
but no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them 31.697883971376065 
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me 8.817148593105767 
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself 64.18343426604736 
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week 11.749253349763267 
it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea 70.08544086485286 
" mrs bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _fine eyes_ 66.1554224152556 
" " though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit 36.46359702222507 
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road 15.786743804859817 
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner 28.98751619834942 
when tea was over , mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain 17.68974622973622 
" " were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr collins very gravely " but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 31.477385979772876 
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park 32.721432960574006 
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 73.528087039614 
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 18.776808391224453 
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals 71.28604189345097 
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour 19.0623826110826 
he has children of his own , and may have more 10.293787630186547 
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers 10.12900780249658 
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country 30.4466912810548 
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 9.05619575244512 
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? " " i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 65.09953273793072 
" " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more 14.243051628847779 
" " certainly , " replied elizabeth " there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ 21.65219496398061 
such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing 26.090736092929273 
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements 20.41498205079505 
it was all conjecture 3.0627362632151587 
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself 21.67462823651483 
" on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away 20.545500420122625 
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation ' s web site and official page at <URL> for additional contact information : dr 29.193395111749282 
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance 20.355173114931734 
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 76.58407704404108 
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend 29.9941988046829 
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness 30.549366021303054 
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr darcy ' s regard 18.332398092045313 
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion 19.44848905735803 
mr jones says we must not think of moving her 9.082944557588128 
" " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 30.37431426439013 
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful 8.18720467736485 
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good 14.01411190225912 
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange 36.04127784497802 
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends 44.810236285079355 
" " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do 16.35900367585479 
elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more 44.22162918392498 
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable 42.341037013752256 
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling 41.44624672542471 
she declared her resolution 2.9834103370341634 
but that is not the case _here_ 5.855078047898329 
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry 22.39978772025371 
dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s 17.14586313475445 
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them 16.947684078921508 
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday 55.55989986175569 
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? " the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it 78.9833842731687 
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved 63.680912599649375 
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere 76.43650503358049 
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much 7.86805827460991 
" " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either 17.124637117805705 
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines 12.564977100339854 
" " it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud 16.67731010322537 
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 53.334842143627476 
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 40.35700982930271 
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 35.84116348098763 
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months 47.25000445735802 
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect 52.682288124251116 
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on 36.502552832868965 
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 13.478165704406093 
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour 18.210947696022195 
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go 10.300932797694918 
" " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary 73.31032265510959 
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it 10.85771528292487 
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant 20.46414511870714 
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 42.394563351712726 
" " but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit 23.350591219476026 
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr darcy 89.72162739471565 
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 19.053487125062876 
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been 49.21132150132426 
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty 28.893848633751134 
" " i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 34.46256859253706 
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it 8.866304018314167 
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort 36.1447566369648 
i shall see her in january 4.8892858840672435 
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 13.4623994194515 
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 37.90142932085749 
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her 47.19620112949185 
her answer was warmly in his favour 5.8827416109348185 
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him 30.24117573970533 
she longed to see mrs philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs hill and the two housemaids 57.67029524239006 
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield 17.04842480687641 
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty 22.070451290053896 
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone 58.15142675421136 
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him 30.636611496960036 
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight 13.80152404197651 
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone 18.384036359624396 
it will save me a world of trouble and economy 9.038152709759505 
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out 45.454220100512636 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 49.347551566748855 
" " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth 19.436277082659636 
i am afraid you will be angry 6.032844160185793 
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary 13.904718488743017 
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips 29.318980546840717 
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday 16.849252997595723 
" " she did indeed , louisa 6.115758213252573 
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know 26.71158810097821 
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 27.755351972967652 
" oh mr collins " " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point 22.993789964956168 
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy 9.811294645948067 
mr collins then returned to elizabeth 5.125726964005148 
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 39.17369966029177 
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it 54.41818579184813 
but no one can throw any blame on them 8.016877970108583 
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion 59.50709241533782 
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 9.263462791830277 
" " indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 29.73865583231031 
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 14.922212551906306 
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew 12.264927484916479 
" in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 74.82226883395303 
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley 11.62762004705529 
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 70.20768416128358 
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her 34.33360250804058 
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it 21.626983999886132 
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 33.0074738615028 
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms 20.802780173944345 
elizabeth immediately began playing again 4.005904729254472 
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough 13.1914369192538 
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 36.035894243929214 
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn 20.792437433224137 
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 17.59735064937224 
" darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right 9.893717110957123 
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 62.2649341441469 
oh why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express 30.641271365952633 
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous 23.697448802585356 
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate 28.38862935260182 
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 26.570357563407295 
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred 12.901082129546149 
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 16.343581734144564 
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia 51.49440019892118 
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge 36.825884305799406 
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance 31.245955291126826 
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were 12.583835059133765 
" " i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent 46.286170491795126 
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family 34.03333185645909 
i hope there was 2.892403044893725 
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me 18.74280975806727 
" " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree 17.40693378304179 
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak 22.0335718767991 
" " we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply 21.275314530069195 
every body is disgusted with his pride 5.912062474537135 
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast 11.993815039789894 
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him 57.87543281165516 
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention 12.587447412311956 
" " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " oh yes 17.422501896917414 
she had always felt that charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage 41.317021973373286 
" " what , none of you ? " " not one 11.010281220033102 
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation 13.929291910811523 
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 49.794233392011556 
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding 14.243292366257016 
" but depend upon it , mr collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason 19.90193173747877 
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject 13.290437441453454 
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are 29.514063949468117 
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds 15.125082245519954 
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure 43.338374088593376 
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times 28.01290286178077 
" " but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt 29.553212484226496 
to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing 25.36796406143615 
" " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy 27.611776304451208 
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun 11.19793369485476 
in three volumes 1.9909220761813655 
my aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing 19.439612660937474 
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 20.84464263109302 
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone 10.854391779935323 
" " i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia 32.79682858229044 
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together 39.81377421131794 
" " your humility , mr bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof 15.480430925394554 
and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large 86.86919356478143

laws alone swamp our small staff 5.26723534154051 
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 7.058936235427285 
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 22.95534680692938 
mr darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart 16.318082590970768 
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 23.40210360092476 
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 28.519889969315397 
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph 1 14.71984765333619 
" " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match , " cried elizabeth 20.270572782910712 
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me 9.203497305233954 
" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence 18.055625660783303 
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 7.79336770212456 
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation 10.098765341172019 
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london 42.51351290324151 
" " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 63.50029295648125 
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman 54.46498434352762 
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief 34.495205177649375 
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself 15.024658743370113 
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family 33.84194082726096 
to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point 16.15075029542111 
" " oh shocking " cried miss bingley 7.111078646232201 
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter 45.69741581856123 
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it 16.075413963160738 
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 18.344312525949743 
" " if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think 21.01227703885465 
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 23.701249621934952 
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 13.117957639463597 
" " you have 3.076592514190908 
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was 46.40012023779741 
but we are all liable to error 6.048410367488736 
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted 10.945521253361722 
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off " to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures 50.643214836468644 
" " aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself 44.73346462738636 
" " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 13.754180266500558 
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so 17.639173808228925 
" your ' s sincerely , c 5.97294223702201 
" " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use 23.395587877561105

in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend 22.12739209497506 
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed 18.952738890789483 
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 19.42453599844835 
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular 57.2591303352435 
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation 31.732397274179796 
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 23.917045892829083 
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it 48.668802010192564 
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable 4.7873418135694115 
when mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure 13.984241189412138 
" " that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth 14.939549605795055 
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected 25.297584742531654 
" " what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr darcy had much better finish his letter 26.241105911538828 
" " compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means 24.28974910704726 
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made 23.149862897201256 
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long 26.82007822858885 
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary 56.02756234522387 
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful 26.330907905543768 
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth 14.079569250161601 
" mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as mr gardiner could do 25.372267793329442 
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge 19.963634632119163 
" " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 22.13650800945412 
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well 57.243567059375025 
it cannot be concealed from any one 5.8661405304809655 
she had ventured only one glance at darcy 6.963541830688967 
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age 86.38665979763493 
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 23.289598860236556 
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would 32.91199849877174 
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others 31.21220173755694 
pray read on 2.0346089228693516 
" " and have you heard from him often ? " " we have heard only once 15.886776931374417 
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed 23.70968517526219 
all field sports were over 3.955559211684613 
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream 64.74376540725208 
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 78.74119788114503 
" " in what an amiable light does this place him " thought elizabeth 13.092104799986437 
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much 24.00160348546794 
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother 14.162912252040764 
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 17.25885304922597 
they were to be off as soon as possible 7.991033139076024 
" " if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " i never heard that it was 41.853088846390904 
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made 70.86439466014372 
oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen " wickham , lydia , were all forgotten 17.720989187675396 
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain 26.399558425072325 
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 17.09882007223607 
" " not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise 15.74281969759837 
" and is this all ? " cried elizabeth 7.970769495818995 
" i am afraid , mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes 30.746954104422358 
" " not as you represent it 5.9020395240935155 
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 71.29883774553291 
" " yes , indeed , " cried mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 19.14287131631877 
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that _i_ might have prevented it _i_ who knew what he was 28.04516518731444 
" i , who have prided myself on my discernment i , who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust 39.974976881195225 
" " so much the better 4.886223696421049 
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand 15.934777590708306 
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character 9.6462334732703 
his surprise was great 2.8855391123163705 
" " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm 27.108082923780664 
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips 20.102868903048098 
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her 31.56363997543334 
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied 27.04487895416912 
human nature is so prone to fall into it no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 25.895477498916726 
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing 49.357008572206254 
" elizabeth could bear it no longer 6.025625389040314 
_that_ is all settled 2.979419594460295 
" " what think you of books ? " said he , smiling 12.110666156201095 
does she live near you , sir ? " " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ' s residence 33.58428036920501 
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 18.967028159157884 
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 18.089078715168625 
it is highly improper 2.9829629584051527 
" " indeed " cried wickham with a look which did not escape her 13.475885270347982 
" " you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth 12.493818933298668 
you have delighted us long enough 5.271634468880336 
" " nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility 15.976286763553647 
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected 14.031386664777553 
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction 33.475010870113515 
your ' s , c 4.086798678021703 
" " but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him 26.297847020467007 
" i never heard any thing so abominable 6.942755248072023 
i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret " " if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject 38.03100769928799 
" " and i have another favour to ask 8.24382317631765 
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 34.70148890231128 
and , above all things , keep mr bennet from fighting 9.938312486606367 
unfortunately an only son , for many years an only _child_ i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 83.42949854751554 
and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say 17.606052884025857 
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can ' t write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me 30.018003127591395 
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman 23.561452656897497 
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect 13.835650963494643 
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others 33.15929062532383 
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley 14.767942445522607 
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem 20.557091201292476 
" " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required 15.95210701614102 
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen 72.38662685538893 
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe 31.284434879852554 
they had several children 2.9408006132584408 
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn 13.927439955027792 
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 28.110800547221533 
" " well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? " " what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it 45.46179265458504 
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 60.25431407827907 
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations 17.075145867689038 
" " i never can be thankful , mr bennet , for any thing about the entail 16.504883360382294 
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 48.283508420674465 
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 47.617623516616305 
what a fine thing for our girls " " how so ? how can it affect them ? " " my dear mr bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 48.6961996392689 
she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility 32.29742658658079 
" " good god what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr and mrs gardiner 46.05631082827516 
you see on what a footing we are 6.979930057174028 
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine 17.43491867394011 
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear 12.722027296665273 
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all 10.971587108154502 
mr philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 16.66582064792163 
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt 9.11039577799818 
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words 41.565205907050654 
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her 46.265943799026026 
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh , that i knew how it was " but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 46.73387884591733 
" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat 26.76468081741552 
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house 16.083686982898403 
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st 11.196939547621168 
" " what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town 14.371958503266804 
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 48.27433328401958 
" " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself 41.835632084790504 
the party did not supply much conversation 5.7586530293596905 
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 20.537211949481254 
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr darcy 52.712433196464275 
he readily agreed to it 4.049538955907295 
i think i have heard you say that you know them 10.03146435164728 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 6.166493443410842 
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time 44.66281962083904 
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back 14.092647761359245 
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant 7.325084490114225 
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable 16.95311496980359 
" " how should you have liked making sermons ? " " exceedingly well 13.338831119109447 
her report was highly favourable 3.925489761742798 
what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know 21.573842675146835 
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 83.88730742912624 
" they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived 48.22774099740802 
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 94.05808053232694 
i hate such false friends 3.929173349247116 
" " you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition 23.784773024205276 
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 21.595291710390683 
but mr gardiner could not be seen , and mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning 31.706229170727866 
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 49.40664938350897 
" " do you suppose them to be in london ? " " yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty 37.73852192246659 
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 11.142286472978943 
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 19.434358236464664 
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham 18.062233190718246 
" i should never have said mrs collins was settled _near_ her family 11.748476272028325 
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time 43.713535113847406 
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song 42.91357936774354 
not one party , or scheme , or any thing 8.964947931490846 
and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? their manners are not equal to his 21.4356871306827 
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 15.831373592573314 
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once 33.83104639770034 
but these are not jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design 14.19685937604294 
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it 16.63567866845381 
but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 33.2362773366323 
i have no such injuries to resent 5.868453185877001 
mrs hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker 25.550757045137637 
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance 12.753348658022317 
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 19.149106356341004 
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 38.88007285162775 
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err 54.116219930324604 
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 10.441309851801657 
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 48.22004491352649 
i desire you will stay where you are 6.989349497630153 
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life 11.782963387897098 
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing 74.3393522629249 
" " you need not distress yourself 5.91644454119774 
that lady i suppose is your mother 5.982050051636089 
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable 52.86627158797765 
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy 8.169688499210594 
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people 15.430493189922473 
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen 18.043471916160307 
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs hurst and miss bingley 17.548312424190986 
charlotte the wife of mr collins , was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 48.012322335432074 
" " why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned 14.18819853546149 
a thousand things may arise in six months " the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 20.846447731235788 
" she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success 23.33424530041751 
attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham 11.049718405214033 
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 21.862880438497687 
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family 43.0503471238951 
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn 19.764060512313144 
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it 16.439021154904314 
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes 14.939252528535052 
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose 16.11794102522175 
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books 21.976306575196084 
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her 24.202477535393733 
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you 38.39958369297867 
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling 6.338650266927647 
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on 21.527155388492087 
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune 36.518028497772825 
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile 17.082043268685812 
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head 21.687079635419447 
" i hope , my dear , " said mr bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party 45.55263171125323 
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it 5.080714610515767 
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly 19.47967705147091 
he still loves me , and we are engaged 8.153216217156478 
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 23.864088269135628 
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley ' s continued absence 23.910343559158974 
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us 26.400413847270706 
but will they make you happy ? " " have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " none at all 31.542403760563115 
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 34.03978934267519 
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself 26.783178873495395 
" not at all 2.9843620319683475 
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth 25.18615176223884 
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter 25.21637588274949 
it will not do 3.032130531908288 
what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual 36.04066147421544 
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it 24.74706285266714 
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather 23.457847008889775 
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride 9.962901464289178 
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 8.270871846983402 
she had very little notice from any but him 8.151633040507514 
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion 11.375282396962621 
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day 37.92988562899989 
" i am sure there is not on _his_ 8.043966544220298 
" oh my dear mr bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball 26.487913085062235 
but they did pass away , and mr and mrs gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn 22.027273909477035 
" i have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 27.9852392153315 
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 24.137926652828515 
" " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about 21.165962611332496 
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared 12.082044747889215 
" " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before 27.145799179367046 
i am sick of them all 5.114517414008864 
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 16.106099013251416 
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to 36.22538143585849 
" elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation 14.187441449198662 
every body said how well she looked ; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice 20.030521772969767 
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 24.57916654700701 
" " i know them a little 6.083108996268524 
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 25.4244596215256 
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth 34.62217440194988 
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her 19.660026678540437 
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it 42.889180251921054 
" " these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth 9.145231236765472 
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " oh , yes you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all 34.912967882540336 
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations 45.37068002498318 
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 34.53640792216362 
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you 47.547634709103825 
you must learn some of my philosophy 6.096572778622374 
" " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied 16.354280234940735 
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 5.8025869566753805 
" " not the slightest 3.8556570339080745 
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty 14.15610860794068 
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it 9.022837393923934 
she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 59.65823081352592 
she went on 2.2030136576107364 
" " i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 22.843210141154298 
" " you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound 13.355767139406625 
wickham will never marry a woman without some money 8.160347737338773 
" i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her 8.24984231592069 
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern 8.8345271925005 
" " your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me 22.076091269826545 
it is a nice long walk , and mr darcy has never seen the view 13.79082649100126 
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before 91.65026420284099 
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ' s remarks 15.34621297228519 
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected 44.888513521321904 
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents 35.417713831045354 
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret 11.796259153572803 
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 27.344471859754456 
" elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance 100.2731382498569 
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all 9.728186523098639 
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 18.90530084805895 
" " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled 19.102924540297995 
" mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 6.81449690799049 
it was really a very handsome thought 6.102117396238914 
i see the imprudence of it 5.069980869123226 
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family 66.73751209439743 
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted 36.19816625851481 
every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 56.589497869997246 
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr darcy afterwards discharged 63.93328039009291 
" " we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherine and lydia 16.065199501323463 
console lady catherine as well as you can 7.105776632807781 
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home 33.442190319477064 
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips 29.921511920810396 
" " it is difficult indeed it is distressing 8.137072660501138 
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears 19.497416453023185 
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable 19.60563522611784 
" you have insulted me , in every possible method 9.25922066370927 
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise 35.179412808225685 
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight 7.942496216994249 
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ 7.154823328033376 
and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter 16.900378725822623

" " i should be sorry indeed , if it were 10.339701515356607 
thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 27.818305367547985 
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another 55.69082906187207 
there was no help for it however 5.714297910475007 
in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 27.16746927076453 
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on 20.438560345985792 
" " upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield 22.51977223144349 
" " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him 15.58818705508569 
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil 30.598647892092046 
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him 9.831000427694683 
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy 24.95256406832508 
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave 26.50512899720282 
" the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual 34.76430950111196 
i must find mr gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose 21.064490553628705 
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 38.43883396404309 
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 16.45208839832759 
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match 94.44336793946748 
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 11.185972542789425 
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy 28.366897888750245 
i saw them the night before last 6.107731355130949 
" oh , yes he was to come there with wickham , you know 13.173818381233689 
" elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off 19.173208098640703 
society , i own , is necessary to me 7.883837152853194 
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? " " to morrow fortnight 15.17912378570534 
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him 52.07057714931603 
her ladyship was highly incensed 4.228089880403252 
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way 22.582632428433076 
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger 19.92998671567859 
he does not want abilities 4.007340558525903 
by tea time however the dose had been enough , and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 40.3963432299118 
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante 15.3766461555299 
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better 17.698367638781757 
" " that is not very likely ; our authority was too good 12.141923354829123 
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day 37.508236628794 
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply 22.950148574295373 
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 42.69680456957888 
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed 75.3614998978254 
" " it is more than i engage for , i assure you 12.468727375351735 
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table 40.230560249264165 
there was another reason too for her opposition 6.7758822324227825 
limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the " right of replacement or refund " described in paragraph 1 18.680687871531212 
before any answer could arrive from mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 31.807439815789568 
" " pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe 24.693103962375243 
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way 37.56830149810728 
i am prodigiously proud of him 4.934386469378581 
in as short a time as mr collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness 73.19351070453857 
_he_ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain 75.70732178374458 
i cannot think so very ill of wickham 6.917821021833628 
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 26.843896477876747 
" " care of him yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care 22.61557489974695 
" and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr collins 34.09796162379675 
" " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger 30.633479495198117 
" " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 31.079652648791225 
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy 8.127623988488374 
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr darcy , she was directly retreating 45.45268422085417 
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight 31.39798674760346 
" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason 47.48200249114524 
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended 12.929565835721549 
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle 15.255916004778463 
mr collins must excuse me 3.9227284929902724 
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding 38.37217512068662 
" " i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer 15.855168012223155 
how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes , the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly 28.55888371871374 
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children 7.875992385883573 
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 40.739728694434035 
" jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness 15.360168224759834 
mr bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 102.3650205260979 
" " that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily 15.323329474642515 
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground 10.968151840615459 
" " i see no occasion for that 7.161134557748645 
" mr bennet ' s expectations were fully answered 8.090570453917174 
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits 13.54127323989985 
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions 36.45194307817324 
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 13.944166991963383 
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem 14.014373423231644 
miss lucas is married and settled 5.072713197229884 
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 9.094183381345516 
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner 17.490529886035596 
we want none of them ; do we ? " darcy had walked away to another part of the room 19.111551657435914 
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood 50.66425435348732 
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her 43.4012443240667 
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced 27.170589296965638 
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable 22.496349301366518 
" " your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it 48.07180888887057 
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving 17.051469786482308 
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 37.520280559649876

when this was done , she had a less active part to play 11.54842270230557

young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life 15.51155148755274 
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? " to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it 51.65925340198463 
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 19.63389570880651 
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 42.11457775269713 
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ 10.984690904414766 
_i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united 18.8164577848134

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 24.93525116899623 
she answered him with cold civility 4.99808232431931 
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it 31.177572544148553

bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter 14.097198220296065 
mr collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give 38.989238409539894 
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her 22.905509736143895

" could i expect it to be otherwise " said she 10.232964084949945 
" " he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man 10.929358730611783 
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings 63.30570624721532

her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return 53.249936059714265 
" then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet 14.023758094591184 
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better 27.749757332607704 
i congratulate her 2.017364757758911 
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 7.882774843819619 
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was 14.978816000914373 
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid 51.173700153758496 
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 17.04776122484927 
" he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " elizabeth looked archly , and turned away 36.969985365408064 
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley 75.93812757980349 
1 through 1 1.9610500063973482 
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him 21.055040717716782 
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea 50.98430497791897 
" " it is evident by this , " added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter 20.239430395239683 
" " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth 8.919057721304837 
i do not know who is good enough for him 9.111412160210493 
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 42.697768020799955 
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush 14.951547472013775 
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different 14.952294606449726 
he wrote last week to hurry my return 7.245803008474559 
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither 33.64810901168458 
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 38.00373126821532 
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all 18.832819935317815 
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one 16.19377387521872 
these causes must be stated , though briefly 7.038516040132132 
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome 21.86701595050693 
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel 38.45754845016791 
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 33.50411603426132 
what is your own opinion ? " " that it ought not to be attempted 13.918102195308107 
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give 98.93530994908618 
" " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him 33.928653358256085 
mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way 46.24035363776461 
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression 16.1650236318735 
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 14.84688091562165 
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 65.55204306297625 
" " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london 14.020348462840248 
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother 11.881091326096557 
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward 15.022899823266288 
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none 21.719081218615468 
" oh lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all if i could but see _you_ as happy if there _were_ but such another man for you " " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you 54.14238611806534 
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation 30.144496399808762 
" elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 7.167687673263231 
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning 88.99986577625512 
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country 29.306316549860714 
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified 12.732515454908619 
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me 44.1874853541262 
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest 9.571319028138632 
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you 21.963261531125866 
" " yes , in conjunction with his friend 8.185053573399738 
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance 51.87744344649942

the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained 50.78640165373325 
oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him 22.679848163625827 
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away 28.99829622188523 
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument 23.41122066228725 
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go 94.28451783296303 
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old 19.5013493324759

about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged 27.58952278575628 
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 28.238963946868957 
" " whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ 26.552272822884078 
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body better looking 24.910887358571216 
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection 16.011092306737183 
" " how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 18.13277202019517 
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 9.885373398056997 
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance 39.06557415433589 
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it 17.393025327684825 
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again 30.667960742407264 
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure 13.18247562759389 
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty 13.031460233820404 
" " no , no , nonsense , lizzy 8.138567486726002 
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 45.983929077177066 
" " mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife 12.143978192957947 
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before 20.01589284931259 
you will be a very happy woman 6.068264088269282 
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 45.80341785764086 
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin 19.131800402887286 
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too 18.92573895229753 
do let me ask my partner to introduce you 8.202469310633392 
but at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey 14.769300190024772 
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it 21.048870201075022 
it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her 43.83667147393989 
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , who , however , may live many years longer , i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years 83.63575097994982 
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 44.98347068705395 
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate 48.16003437369852 
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 19.727879016080653 
i will only add , god bless you 7.139513603589714 
pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance 39.49907140857675 
mr bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his 59.45936377905157 
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter " " la my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine 44.25265276751893 
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 29.10310428016028 
" " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time 15.16988777993819 
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr darcy they had only seen at church 22.13087012095924 
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did 13.899963925504487

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door 40.19743427985412 
you deserve no such attention 3.986625098612197 
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings 28.906121732591767 
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me 22.709473268392575 
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence 32.15730277519356 
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 52.605056334858894 
" " i certainly shall not 5.1000767037684565 
she was ashamed to think how much 5.834660998760064 
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence 11.206512963651777 
i am most seriously displeased 3.928826826145001 
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body 30.791529865914182 
" how good it was in you , my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last 20.001410052801656 
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together 14.868030253457169 
" " that is to say , you had given your permission 11.195646708455843 
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s 28.44205120776481 
mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase 47.03907128248093 
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 30.17460283643259 
and mrs forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least 59.31538846177335 
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 42.656791754253625 
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 25.988111474707136 
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning 24.601348849288105 
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all 13.115683030623261 
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections 26.20390885727586 
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound 51.589286773929544 
" " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley ; " and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well 30.07213905773588 
you provide , in accordance with paragraph 1 7.124259763054394 
" " dining out , " said mrs bennet , " that is very unlucky 14.390111227418606 
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world 14.769455908118802 
she will be taken good care of 6.003430851936037 
but now it was all too natural 5.9145839813018695 
we can all _begin_ freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement 29.442920843775866 
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found 26.472392863141934 
" are you not diverted ? " " oh yes 9.095042799051619 
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement 20.188283306529378 
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 19.00817766279487 
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies 20.110050005902796 
" " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley 18.146789506287064 
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr collins ' s correspondence for any consideration 46.79247052177314 
" my dear mr bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? " mr bennet replied that he had not 34.618320217206886 
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten 36.27441319177076 
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success 25.923396240191554 
" " what is his name ? " " bingley 8.736770888091105 
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood 14.747877510480215 
" how could you begin ? " said she 7.999230290213647 
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen 22.829276628852277 
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? " " _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ 20.669339919580782 
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained 14.345808742992215 
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it 35.77757552936231 
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your ' s 56.98931609695346 
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour 62.011817994710185 
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family 11.928089100165062 
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the shire 71.38885049043061 
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room 16.7065357037935 
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 37.77866251819594 
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well 16.08274809358049 
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her 44.38670988336239 
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance 44.39064838367445 
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it 10.279181762520155 
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is 70.90699677290804 
but no such recollection befriended her 4.901544983060863 
there was no want of discourse 5.0163407971302245 
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention 26.412422047830713 
they are my old friends 3.9055698947165896 
" again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 19.10362564187629 
mr bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself 30.134403175792947 
" " my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request 17.23369009058064 
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself 37.56658378012149 
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " this walk is not wide enough for our party 18.02965583134971 
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers 9.687916244026967 
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object 46.718230183818406 
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all 17.221207539915007 
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her 16.460548065091373 
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 22.15587653190422 
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 14.29192910149065 
he had to be sure done much 6.233587367823535 
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 18.101612259913782 
it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk 29.183035951780113 
but i will no longer importune my young cousin 8.179454574416996

he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 31.505358364650217 
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace 23.222836086042072 
" " but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered 23.570382510806446 
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it 27.274708045244488 
there is something very pompous in his style 7.1348939031918555 
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me 31.592940130758596 
such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon 38.19778650854979 
" elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father " she could have added , " a young man too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner " " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care 135.0062092445984 
" darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject 12.322145649071855 
" " indeed you are mistaken 5.319171627435701 
" " i am sure i shall break _mine_ , " said lydia 12.341702042903794 
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 30.814487774399897 
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 46.718349862234476 
" we can all plague and punish one another 7.716103363586629 
" " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter 15.244696904436223 
" " at four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said mr bennet , as he folded up the letter 28.08979319380539 
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 60.40964439236206 
" elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself 23.14697004756509 
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious 10.648111002765134 
" with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself 42.2332817558471 
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient 52.598434541488864 
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states 16.078845106601744 
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her 20.90254363063468 
who would have thought she could be so thin and small " " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 26.488960456606332 
" " do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment 15.98893653924718 
a few weeks , he believed 5.384422547063658 
jane was by no means better 4.88726594011365 
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body 18.030588225163424 
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection 23.091849654974762 
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them 38.029593109896815 
he heard her with astonishment 3.9084847600473935 
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory 9.01956944512446 
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever 17.53943986765173 
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself 124.61483869670427 
that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr gardiner 34.53179293095244 
" " but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh no , no , this is not likely 28.7716274419025 
the officers will find women better worth their notice 8.027394816927266 
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy 47.109905044888016 
" " yes ; he introduced us to his sister 9.095044806490248 
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind 25.46018208210629 
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house 25.379590839787014 
" " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " he brought it with him for us to see 27.141812567724216 
i have a high respect for your nerves 7.097245056725221 
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice oh , lydia " " i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her 57.144804055573346 
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford 5.878670079781984 
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish 9.1716335322623 
" " yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it 11.47497434391231 
" " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy 22.387486992761765 
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance 10.361596601418869 
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud 13.379331459382572 
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr darcy about it , if you had rather not 30.660685059587088 
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 47.37185519678805 
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman 54.905229211696884

but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr darcy ? " " they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine 33.65615064656436 
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news 13.21734706816877 
what relates to yourself , is as follows 7.01329052912565 
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him 31.531296889849983 
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it 11.978649793058782 
" elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion 45.799592208060616 
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr darcy " " it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations 32.04443167575595 
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said 33.11721928781708 
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her 37.40942622911586 
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 50.31415989345867 
mrs bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr collins began 16.58323399793361 
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 25.002283589548384 
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain 32.86639024320345 
" " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him 83.43441101527975 
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 16.29968337292244

allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , glancing at her sister and bingley , shall take place 49.59553255579367

elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal 21.285662240588724 
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister 11.032315019377416 
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister ' s being in town 17.56832316955533 
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this 12.77924749235391 
" " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 20.078871000403414

jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 18.224142858117506 
" mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment 25.176009329884725 
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him 17.762640867604457 
my feelings will not be repressed 5.081236766287955 
stop me whilst you can 3.9595698513063455 
" " oh hang kitty what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 47.742673573656084 
" " has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court 17.323054688151274 
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made 38.49793825646479 
we now come to the point 4.868741961344783 
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture 26.95590033388977 
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country 39.21122913866168 
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " as she pronounced these words , mr darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 83.81132712423822 
" " from mr collins and what can _he_ have to say ? " " something very much to the purpose of course 22.190028794724697 
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam 16.03253986130832 
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ 10.346652613869324 
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself 43.24633452385959 
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first 23.876166636320296 
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 34.3901718524709 
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom 13.785489079753203 
" i hope , " added mrs gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her 21.1077826110187 
how humiliating is this discovery yet , how just a humiliation had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind 23.774164776962238

" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 38.016532930198636 
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with 44.865949717979426 
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer 10.215157121075242 
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes 25.979245317558576 
" " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir 12.008151317697699 
" " i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing 12.47255053637979 
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away 22.79426662757772

" " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate 9.824460269673352 
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property 45.81702528059078 
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 36.416754234591984 
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn 38.355757325041075 
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary 21.319314751017156 
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north 29.562210380489553 
" what do you mean , mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him 23.44772542479406 
his doing so drew her notice 5.16823371226674 
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance 62.68582346440579 
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy 41.01646245094119 
you shall hear what she says 5.001856394102177 
" " true 1.9654557841936595 
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin 28.644999044905145 
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 21.141736599827073 
" " you shall have it in few words 8.108931807142998 
" " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out 23.973135392384933 
" " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other 25.23856559981532 
" " oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you 14.165003132232865 
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it 11.489526467821205 
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled 9.241546850484863 
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months 60.88879783765045 
" " they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 35.50707443370214 
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for 38.55862264415511 
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true 61.90660696648468

" elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room 32.377625436472755 
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 14.110326337764908 
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered 34.20048060513343 
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly 32.943317046866504

his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle ' s doings generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself 31.436324189795886 
you _are_ a gentleman ' s daughter 6.008682905020942 
" good gracious " cried mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company 69.51493114392086 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it 25.29767730306589 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield 36.066235147187605 
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness 19.802888899446142 
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible 38.42316065892839 
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things 10.28974186387221 
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked 9.041596200879477 
" " what should not you mind ? " " i should not mind any thing at all 17.647309413096558 
" " dear lizzy " " oh you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general 21.459051616742563 
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business 20.41876114821651 
" kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry 15.066450666120733 
" " i am not now to learn , " replied mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time 65.7611643392577 
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 52.689056495756454 
but i know the foundation is unjust 5.954629796360738 
" " poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner 21.901973922637897 
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy 15.244125016314731 
" lydia declared herself satisfied 4.118282204367313 
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations 10.058448685376748 
" miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 16.72465589307295 
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion 39.5109833389158 
i want to talk very seriously 4.7713984128520845 
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene 88.68345295305787 
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course 14.039866109463933 
" " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west 21.260046045322376 
" " upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person 23.026996478336816 
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done 19.144759825721554 
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon 23.839285461590087 
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr bingley ? " " when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same 46.61400594363912 
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 32.00186434775634 
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious 23.113801767576685 
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 27.451005397329173 
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane 9.853547528102437 
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music 14.085540680059346 
i am glad he dines here on tuesday 7.120483516095473 
all connection between us seemed now dissolved 6.128330313943775 
" " well , my dear , " said mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley , and under your orders 57.847977631955295 
" " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out 18.401241627663808 
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 41.803745758384075 
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 12.00838719471984 
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe 92.0317337538653 
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 21.99167709927056 
it is because he will not give himself the trouble 8.827426112526073 
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation 17.868328122188213 
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away 30.347841822053326 
" during their walk , it was resolved that mr bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening 22.292681284030046 
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 21.341744422552193 
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time 24.090101700283615 
as for their mother , mr collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters 38.08676022151594 
" but how did he account for it ? " " it must have been his sister ' s doing 18.503935618611752 
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together 41.61246136908353 
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved 10.212127352113729 
" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 50.96227832763656 
" " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason 21.587813676289684 
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me 39.316881758555795 
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away 37.67874940569979 
" excuse my interference 2.8765674776869825 
_i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 12.042529679882907 
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 5.8647069950718524 
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 28.585866048665267 
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful 59.41957271273881 
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave 29.23877712021718 
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before 21.323794363672153 
" " now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table 20.03622877880267
