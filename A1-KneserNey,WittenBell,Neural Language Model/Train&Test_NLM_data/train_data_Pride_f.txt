 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph
" "his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can assure you, he informed me himself
 "you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem
 the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with
 excuse me--for i must speak plainly
 "do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently
 the particulars, i reserve till we meet
 my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties
 our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast
--lady catherine then observed, "your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think
" she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued, "you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it
 a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago
 could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected

 they had long wished to see him
 "yours, &c
 "indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!" "my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts
 mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them
--come, kitty, i want you up stairs
_ dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london, mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself
" "yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
 mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure
 all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating
" on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?" "with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic
 seriously, i would have you be on your guard
 he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening
 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here
 lydia came to us; and wickham had constant admission to the house

 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken
 i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago
 with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock
" "mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library
" on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must
 her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family

 only look at her
 in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl
--elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits
" "the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily changed as that implies
--elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled
 but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her
 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life
 under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief
 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune
 of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find
 "i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his
 "let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation
 my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often
 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other
 "aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way
 "then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
 sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty
 two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask
" "i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
 darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it
 mrs gardiner abused her stupidity
 your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk together
" "yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded
--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness
 i will take care of myself, and of mr wickham too
 you are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself

" "a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever
 she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary
" "an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_
" "but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood
 one day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual
 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy
 elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes
" "i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object
 of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure
 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw

 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again
 she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them
 they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent
 he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility
 i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again
 but you are always giving _her_ the preference
 it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match
 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do
" "as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_
" elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit
" "in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere
 both sisters were uncomfortable enough
 "but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine
 i wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect

" "that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_
 mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance
 1
 bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object
" "certainly not; at first
 when she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well
 the recollection of what i then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me
 my visit was not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out
 had the late mr darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence
 "can you come to-morrow?" yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity
 "i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech
" "i hope not so
 if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the rules is very easy
 to the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer
 "no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night
 she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent
 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain
 when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both
" then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself
 we do not suffer by _accident_
 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not
 in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
 "no; but it must be done soon
 by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments
 he studies too much for words of four syllables
 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it
 that he has neither integrity nor honour
 he found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty
 "he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever i saw
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed

 but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground
 nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world
 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart
 elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little
--the part which i acted, is now to be explained
 sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion
 he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father

--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved
 you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer
 "i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried jane
 while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing
 mrs collins knew not what to make of him
" "no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else
 as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents
 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy
 "but what is to be done about pemberley?" cried mrs gardiner
" "what sort of a girl is miss darcy?" he shook his head
 she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him
 her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully
 "and may i ask?" said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with
 at present i am not in love with mr wickham; no, i certainly am not
" "elizabeth, you are not serious now
" "thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be angry
 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be
 when they repaired to the dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister
 she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening
 he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride
 in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton
" "impossible, mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?" "i honour your circumspection
 having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business
 what congratulations will then flow in! i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir
" "it is well
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure
" mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals
 but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton
 but her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent
 the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred
--that they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger
 "good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you," cried jane
 did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had
 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both
 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord, how tired i am!" accompanied by a violent yawn
 "of a fine, stout, healthy love it may
 it will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance
 at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals
" "she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him
 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves
 i hope you have destroyed the letter
 her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter
 "how despicably have i acted!" she cried
--and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could
 but what is that to me? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded
--the necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd
" she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "oh! mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar
 she really looked almost wild
 we had better go into the avenue
 having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy
 she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance
--oh! how acutely did she now feel it
 chapter xiv
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it
 his disposition must be dreadful
" "you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection
 if you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation
" "you have a house in town, i conclude?" mr darcy bowed

 "they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire
 let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them
" "oh, well! it is just as he chooses
 well, he is a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now
 she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy
 1
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before
--but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment
 he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him
 6
 but your _family_ owe me nothing
 "oh! yes--i understand you perfectly
" "and mary king is safe!" added elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune
 as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, "i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone
 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved
 unless a copyright notice is included
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression
 mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared for backgammon
 _she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour
 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening
 "it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's
 when mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten
" "and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley never stirs without him
 it was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do
 i thought i should have broke my heart
 every thing being settled between _them_, mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home
 yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the first, you may remember
 there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body
 their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either one or the other again!" yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover
" "i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject
a
 mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners
--mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained
" "what is it you mean?" "it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing
 wont it, kitty?" kitty owned that she had rather stay at home
 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away
" this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make
" lady catherine seemed pleased
 "she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home
 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder
 about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her
 mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends
 the other is miss de bourgh
 however, i recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well
 darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet
 till this moment, i never knew myself
 i am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed
 there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement
 when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were
 you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i demand it of your justice
 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word
 "oh, jane, take care
 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged

 but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle

 had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way
 in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before
 he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others
 the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth
 elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them
" "perhaps i do
 good gracious! when i went away, i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was
" "and quite alone? have all her friends left her?" "mrs annesley is with her
" mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable
 oh! lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness!" she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care
 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner
 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit

 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough
 at length, she spoke again
 but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible
 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country
 "i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas
 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world
" "and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body
 mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings
 they will have nothing else to do
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection
 _your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance
 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility
 they were in ---- street
 it is not quite a week since they left brighton
 and do you really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection
 he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him
 i will have no reserves from _you_
 "i am glad i bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home
 he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again
 the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention
 in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness
 pride & prejudice
 never, even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings
 "the party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other
 i am impatient to see him
" "miss bennet, do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such language as this
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it
" "and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them
" "let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself
" "that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
 i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
 "you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing
 "what can be the meaning of this!" said charlotte, as soon as he was gone
 well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done
" "you know nothing of the matter
 she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance
 i wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise
 i thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town
 did you see it?" bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations
 she had been unwilling to mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend
 at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself
 she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her
 be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove
 "it must not be thought of
" "oh, no!" said elizabeth
" "indeed!" "yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go
 her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room
 to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love
 "read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is about
" "i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield
--"i wish i could call her amiable
 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark
 chapter viii
 allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
 "i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia," said she, "though i am _not_ her particular friend
 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
 compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements

 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there
 it was very little less
 my father and mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him
 the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater
" "well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth
" "then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
 mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley! how can mr bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other?--do you know mr bingley?" "not at all
 elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma? what do you keep winking at me for? what am i to do?" "nothing child, nothing
 i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all

 her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others
 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement
 the carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time
 in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger
 their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial
 "about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention
 she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class
 but on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away
" "i do not believe a word of it, my dear
" "but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
 it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution
" at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself
 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever
 they may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride
 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject
 the tête-à-tête surprised them
" "it did
" while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning
" she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr hurst had a house

 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever
 mr darcy is engaged to _my daughter_
 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit
--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage
 i am quite well
" "are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?" "both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds
 special rules, set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark
 mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention
 mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation
 the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them
 since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy
 mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry
 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy
 "he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived
 "did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?" "from the former
" "if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far
" miss bennet still looked all amazement

 some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern
 bingley urged mr jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians
 i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming
 i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world
" they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness
1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg-tm license
 i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit
 he knows of my being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy
" "and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well
 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them
--what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing
 jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them
 the gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration
" "and do you impute it to either of those?" "yes; to the last
 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows
 she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is
 you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk
" after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration
 the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid
" "ah! you do not know what i suffer
 thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
 we all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way
 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end
 pray do not talk of that odious man
 he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs
 lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself
 in truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings
 she will follow wherever lydia leads
 "but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
 i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude
" he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, "my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner
 when i last saw her, she was not very promising
 she has two nieces of her own
" "this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure," said he
 "i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr bingley, if she could
 yet, indeed, i am in earnest
 i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here
" another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment
 as the day of his arrival drew near, "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister
 your sister i also watched
 i shall be back by dinner
 it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions
 it is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind
 my poor father! how he must have felt it!" "i never saw any one so shocked
 "what could become of mr bingley and jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs
 in the hall they parted
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor
 at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life
 "indeed, you are mistaken, madam
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer
 "i dare say you will find him very agreeable
 "i am all astonishment
" "why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks
" "la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off

 that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings
 mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters
 she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when
" "you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged
 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday
 a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme
 mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached
 wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is
 in his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her
 1
 bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on
 1813
 on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy
 i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone
 while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road
 he is gone to my father already
" "to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good
 that he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating
 he has heartily forgiven me now
 she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with
" "miss elizabeth bennet!" repeated miss bingley
" mr bingley followed his advice
" "this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said elizabeth
 will you come and see me?" "we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire
 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia
 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_
 mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual
 he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected
 why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the case?" "in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland
 there is a lady, it seems, a mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it
" "no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me
 i am perfectly satisfied
 their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection
 mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house
" chapter xviii
 till i was in kent, and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself
" elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone
" "how can you talk so?"--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit
 we have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will approve
 the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you
" "complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family

" "you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment
 mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not

" "i beg your pardon
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them
 "she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration
" "indeed i do not dare
 the visit was returned in due form
 "your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented
 "you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out
 the path just admitted three
 had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort
 but to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes
 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage
 an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough
 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it
 as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr darcy only, entered the room
" "perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said elizabeth
 in talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again
 she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her
 mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton
 the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt
 the loo table, however, did not appear
 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity
 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before
" "i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly
 but i make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves
 "and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him
 but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's
" "no, no
 egerton, military library, whitehall
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully
" in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "i take no leave of you, miss bennet
--i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements
 1
 but it is all, all too late now
 in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost
 but it is so strange!" "yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing
" "miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance
 more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed
" "i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man
 "i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself
 mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces
 mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many
 i should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship
 bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time
 but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments
" mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in reply to his last
" "is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?" "no, indeed
 i know how much you dislike him
" "this is a wretched beginning indeed! my sole dependence was on you; and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not
 mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income
 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds
" "if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone
" "i cannot believe it
 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own
 "next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky
 her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it
 lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room
 in the former were many good paintings; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible
 you have no compassion on my poor nerves
 mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary
" "that is as it happens
 it is every way horrible!" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence
" then addressing her daughter, "oh! my dear, dear jane, i am so happy! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night
 "oh!" said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply
 the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh
 i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_
" "take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment
 by the author of "sense and sensibility
 his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue
 he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane
 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier
 i shall like it of all things

 "but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
 "i told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him
 when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give
 my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
 lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter
 well, any friend of mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him
 you must not disappoint your father
 "for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her
--we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
 pray, how _violent was_ mr bingley's love?" "i never saw a more promising inclination
 they are all for what they can get
 lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off
 vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love
" "nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley

 he now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as well as of mr darcy

 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her
" mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library
" "of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is
 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more
" "would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!" "he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty
 the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states
 anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost
 elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word
 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe
 it is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these
 the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune
 "with my mother up stairs
 in spite of having been at st
 he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy
 it was over at last however
" her father lifted up his eyes
 i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
 we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon
" "you may as well call it impertinence at once
 she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again
 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away
--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome
 after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress
 the supposition did not pain her
" "oh, yes
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy
 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me
 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake
 well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead
 lady catherine rose also, and they turned back
 in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach
 that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as mr bingley, was incomprehensible
--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears
 "i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london
 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could
 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light
 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter
 "we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes
 miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt
" elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment
 colonel forster will, i dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head
 "but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary
 he did trace them easily to clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom
 _too much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject? this will never do
 your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with
 gardiner
 we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him
 his fear of her, has always operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he has very much at heart
 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's
 she directly replied, "you need not be frightened
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
 and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought we never should have got into the coach
" mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer
 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies
 on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head
" mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family
 not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you
 no arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind
 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much
 mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever
" with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return
 they have some of the finest woods in the country
" "that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever heard you utter
 there's for you! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light
 the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place
 wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her
 he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping lucases
" chapter v
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either
 they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield, and she blushed as she answered, "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family
" "did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?" "i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady
 [illustration: morning dress
 mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring
 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil
 except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1
--i have done with you from this very day
 have you never happened to see her there?" she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet
 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself
" elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them
 chapter xi
 the hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object

 he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend
 you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope, though you have but a short lease
 i dare say i shall soon see them here
" "it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas
" "i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i wish he had danced with eliza
--perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me
 he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm
" vol
 you must contrive to send somebody
 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous
" "my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious

 the rest of the evening brought her little amusement
 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection
 i speak nothing but the truth
 this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part
 how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful
 but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend
 mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and mrs hurst was observing their game
 your reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner
 i will go directly to mr bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure
 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "are you pleased with kent?" a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk
 chapter xii
 it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present

 at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner
" her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters
 the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love
 i hope we may often meet again
" "lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now
 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish
 i
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply
 lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party
" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry
 _they_ will never be distressed for money
 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day

 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him
" not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did mrs bennet give up the point
 these were the contents: "my dear harriet, "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am missed
 "fitzwilliam darcy
 you supposed more than really existed
 as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?" "i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk to oakham mount this morning
 will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him
 this mrs younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town
 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of
--do your sisters play and sing?" "one of them does
 "you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday
" "you are over scrupulous surely
" "remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do
 a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone
 on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn
 though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage
 chapter x
 when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen
 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood
 his debts are to be paid, amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased
 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident
 i depend on you for that
 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland
 could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes
 they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together
 but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph
 "i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him
" "i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice
 she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure
 and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it
--but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without
 but still he would be her husband
 but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair
 and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married
 "my dear father, i congratulate you
 she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther
 you do not look well
 nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law
 mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal
 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him
 never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated to colonel f
 jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs
 "good gracious!" cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!" "a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh
" mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh
 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced
 mr bennet treated the matter differently
" "lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home

" "i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us
 "it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet
 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing
 in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house
 you tear them to pieces
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together

 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after
 what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? if they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed
" "for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance
 she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak

 i must speak to hill, this moment
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation
 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins
 she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it
 then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----" "if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! for god's sake, say no more of his partners
 she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded
 but, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her

 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn
 there was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects
 her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted

 international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states
" this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage

 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month

 _her_ mind was less difficult to develope
 mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head

 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week
 and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind
 mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well
--with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family

 miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps
 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil
 for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions
" elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself
 if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer
 "if one could but go to brighton!" observed mrs bennet
 perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease
 the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them

 sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise
 "is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? can there be any other opinion on the subject?" "yes, there can; for mine is totally different
 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good
 "and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables
 she was teazed by mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others

 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's

" "no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you

 i have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with
 he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence
 of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with
 let me mend it for you
 his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else
 it was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing

 he did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately

" however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister
" "can i have the carriage?" said jane
 mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips's manners and politeness
 having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity
 lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern

 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world
 "and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over
" this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for
 could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? mr darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! it is admirable!" elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile
 on opening the door, she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all
 it is too long ago
 it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases
 "oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable
" "shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to befall her?" "i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance
 i must beg to return to the house
" "no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds

 not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them

 i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister
 and what do you think she said besides? 'ah! mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last
"--my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england

 his pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by
 mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character
 he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire
 lydia was exceedingly fond of him
 "oh! my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "oh, lord! i don't know

" nothing that she could say, however, had any influence
 but whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation
 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose
 _their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse

 we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way
" "you have said quite enough, madam
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
 when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room

 lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them, at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford
" "shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said elizabeth, still addressing colonel fitzwilliam
 i should infinitely prefer a book
" elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them

 they met several times, for there was much to be discussed
" "and my mother--how is she? how are you all?" "my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken
 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and i know i appeared distressed
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages
 mr wickham had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight
 "if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes

 i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished

" their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her
 it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it
 she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended

--of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd
 the dejection was almost universal
e
" "my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do
 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting
--but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own
" the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions
 that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him
" "you are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable
 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate
 elizabeth was delighted
 it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts
 i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him
 that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts
 but she is nothing to me now
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them
 interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other
 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over
--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley
 but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them
" "mr darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried elizabeth
" consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side
" he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton
" mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" "i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy
 whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully
 what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses
--others of the party were now applied to
 "as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you will wait on him of course
 but my dear lydia, i don't at all like your going such a way off
 into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance
 you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_
 wickham passed all his youth there, you know
 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining in, observed, "yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her
" "i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only
 mr collins was eloquent in her praise
 the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now
 i _must_ have employment and society
 but gracious me! i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it

" darcy was fixed in astonishment
 but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done
 has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" "your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner
 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me
 by supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy
 in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness
 this was agreed to, and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards
--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed
 it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world
 do you often dance at st
 i am not equal to it
 no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room
" "miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards
 "good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr darcy! who would have thought it! and is it really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all
 all were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot
; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them
 "yours, &c
 as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery
 mr wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return
" mr bennet made no answer
 "it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded
 i am very, very sorry
 unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring
 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address
" she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley
 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment
 elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill
 mrs bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again
 so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next
 every thing nourishes what is strong already
" away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech
 "your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy
 on finding mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs bennet instantly answered, "oh dear!--yes--certainly
 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this
 this room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then
" "and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?" "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right
--elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply
--mr darcy said very little, and mr hurst nothing at all
 you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others
" mrs bennet's eyes sparkled
 miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page
 when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing farther to wish
 mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding
 very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours
" "do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?" "sometimes

" elizabeth shook her head over this letter
" "that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease
 as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring
 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case
 they are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families
" "mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail
" "i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him
 kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon
 "what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut
" "upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance
" "but i was embarrassed
 "you may well warn me against such an evil
 and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment
" vol
--can he be a sensible man, sir?" "no, my dear; i think not
 mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world
 "you look pale
 to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers
--i really cannot _laugh_ at it
 mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of
--"whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment
 now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature
 i have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle
 what made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?" "because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement
 he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in the north
 "that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman
 mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation
 she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter
 gardiner
--your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr collins, and i will never see you again if you _do_
 but, lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not
 it was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor
 mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him
 he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere
" mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain
 perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice
 what are men to rocks and mountains? oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! and when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing
 he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask
" "he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life
 they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests
 i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing
 it would have been strange if they had
 she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down
 his marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy
 these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you

 when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses
 i dearly love a laugh
" he should be particularly happy at any time, &c
 i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
 at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him
 very nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy, so blowsy!" "yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy returned within the stated time
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment
 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter
 &c
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner
 but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes
 she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade
 are you going much farther?" "no, i should have turned in a moment
 mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing
 "implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character
 mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home
" "i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder
 lydia laughed, and said, "aye, that is just like your formality and discretion
" "oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice
 it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account
 this matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled
 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better
 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking
 but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family

 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement

 she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth
 her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard
 "mrs collins, you must send a servant with them
 his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind

 mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed
 yet he knew to the contrary himself
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with

 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband
" while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner
 more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet mr darcy
" "but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
 to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated
 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent
 "shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" "i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to him
 their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency
 he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia
 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday
" "and men take care that they should
 the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken
" "miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that i am not to be trifled with
 this he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed
 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you
 five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children
 it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her
 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs
" "perhaps that is not possible for any one

 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere
 amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters
 they were ignorant, idle, and vain
 he cannot know what mr darcy is
 the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts
" but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year
" this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them
 "but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing
 the children have been wanting me this half hour
 for about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance
 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information
" jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay
 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town
 they were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited
" "but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball
 but every body is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i assure you
 i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not, but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible

 they insist also on my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me
 she does not yet leave her dressing-room
--the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family

 elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation
 after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?" "and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there
 had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself
" "and have you answered the letter?" said elizabeth
 your daughter elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land
 for your sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line
" "i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
--pray, what is your age?" "with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it

 mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair
 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no
 miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest
" this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas
" mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good
 "and they are really to be married!" cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves
 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned
" "write to me very often, my dear
 we shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all
 as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch
 if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession

 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_
" "there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome
 that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable

" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter
 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary
 he had never had the slightest suspicion
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose
 by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself
 they saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry
 at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family
 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together
 charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility
 when mrs bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before
 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated
 how much you must have gone through!" her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party
 i will try again
 from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl
 things are settled so oddly
 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man
--every savage can dance
 you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income
 i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself
 if you'll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight
 well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone
 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing
 i was uncomfortable enough
 i pity, though i cannot help blaming her
 "from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
 he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again
 i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk
 the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence
 to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own

 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed
 he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage
" "i suspected as much," replied elizabeth
 these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber

 compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never
--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers
 well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king
--gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection
2
 in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind
 you refuse, then, to oblige me
 but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain
" mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master
 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females
 the wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
" "i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony
 it was lady catherine de bourgh
 we must not make him desperate
 mrs bennet was quite disconcerted
" "are they indeed?" cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction
 his letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution
" elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them
 the least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person
" "no
 and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner
 after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her-- "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer

 and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart
 he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible
 but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly
" "except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate
 bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence
 the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have
" "oh!" said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the youngest, i'm the tallest

" "well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents
" "yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine
 but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked
 it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it
 mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth, "i am glad you are come back, lizzy
 mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room
 i do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain
 on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer
" "i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
 but it ended in nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again
 the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification
" mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer
 when all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish
 miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her
" "miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be

 "how nicely we are crammed in!" cried lydia
 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy
 i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy
 mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence
 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother lady catherine

" "your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has too much truth
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable
 my father, however, is partial to mr wickham
" "oh! i am not at all afraid of her dying
" she was gone directly
 he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone
" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now
 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much
 consider mr collins's respectability, and charlotte's prudent, steady character
 your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done
 but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane
" "the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study
 'lady catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure
 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written
 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth
 she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks
 but he found, in reply to this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country
 &c
" "you are mistaken
 soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately
" "their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor i, nor any body, can ever forget
 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind

" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion

" when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
" "you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him
 this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham
 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object
 he now wished it more than ever
 she could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present
 mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c
" "and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did
" "how hard it is in some cases to be believed!" "and how impossible in others!" "but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge?" "that is a question which i hardly know how to answer
 maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no longer
 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty
 those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable
 he is perfectly amiable
 "how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!" he made no answer
 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i trust i am resigned
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment
 "while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough
 "i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you
 my temper i dare not vouch for
" elizabeth looked surprised
 "i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter
 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, "in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned
 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret
 i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her
 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least
 i knew you would be wishing me joy
 it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side
" charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family
 it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been
" "my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not
 we seem to have been designed for each other
 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet

 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it
 "where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door
 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much

" "and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?" "my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour
--miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice
" "yes, very well
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away

" catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former

 and when i returned home, the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time

 soon after you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were
" "can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "yes
 his own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited
 mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement
 if there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence
 "you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age
" "i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face
 how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the ponies is delightful
 and in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount
 mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity
" "i wish it may
--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation
" "yes;--but he seemed to like his second better
 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be
 mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire
 he scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend
 my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart
 how he lived i know not
 but if you are really innocent and ignorant, i must be more explicit
--though lydia had never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected
 i have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, i should think you could not do better

 "if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable

 he begged pardon for having displeased her
 even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away

 she wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence
 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield

 but if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment
 james's
 you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield
 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure
 but that is one great difference between us
" "believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire
 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least
 miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it
 you have employed your time much better
 "and this is always the way with him," she added
 mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder
 miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings
 "i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer

 now what have you to say?" "only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me
 no thanks to his gallantry for that
 can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" "not perhaps of neglecting his own interest
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london
 there is one point, on which i want your advice
 mrs bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was
--_i_ shall not be able to keep you--and so i warn you
 _i_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it
 i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles
 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country

 when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm
--_i_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples
 they found mr bennet still up
 for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path
 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us
 how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you joy?" "that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask
 the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health
 my sisters may write to _me_
--"i assure you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do
 such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous
 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare

 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable
 the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings
 his sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit

 "my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street
" when she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister
 his reception however was of the most flattering kind

 elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room
 one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte, detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear
 with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself
 one must speak a little, you know
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room

 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth

 elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion
 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters
 not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley
 the first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr wickham
 from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going
 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above
" "she is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well
 he had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend

 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance
 towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself
 kitty and me were to spend the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, mrs forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! not a soul knew of it, but col
 in that case he would return no more
 darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence

 a small sum could not do all this

 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to-day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing

 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's looks and behaviour

 such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined

 he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum
 seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence

 _my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure
 it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else

 between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard

 when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication
 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment
 my father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it
 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "in vain have i struggled
 i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way

 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london

--he left netherfield for london, on the day following, as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning
 from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was
 when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted

 but, alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question
" mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh

 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions
 "and then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself
 but does not jane correspond with the sister? _she_ will not be able to help calling
 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as i certainly did
 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side
 he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else
 our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public
 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic
 my dear, dear lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under
 poor jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately
 there was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table

 but in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable

 "this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! so much the better
 i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement
 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom
" "but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very next day
 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion
 in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in london
 but of every other neglect i can believe him capable
 why was he to be the judge?" "you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" "i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy
 "i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly
 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible
 mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it
--her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary
 so imprudent a match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood
 her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged
" "your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence
 your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications
--i know it cannot be long
 mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
 but of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house
 it was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them
 "well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it will last
 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments
" "it is _not_ mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life

 when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation
--elizabeth was in agonies
 he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party
 i always had a value for him
 his belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice
" "upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know
 to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying
 but my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of, that i may have it to-morrow
 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter
 my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! but perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design
" "is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds
 mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection
 there, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard
 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly
 about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon
" "another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_, if i were you
 if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?" "because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it
" "some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_
 "from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor wickham
 arguments are too much like disputes
" "i can easily believe it
 "there is nothing the matter with me
" "who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her
--yes, she will do for him very well
 the day passed much as the day before had done
 miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place
 if this be the case, he deserves you
 you blamed me for coming?" "no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise
"--it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man
 but when they see, as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other

 "my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else! ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'tis as good as a lord! and a special licence

 "my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt
 the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions
 he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself
" they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know
 their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's
 i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name

" "oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things
 if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning
 "how could i ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face

 lizzy declares she will not have mr collins, and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin
 upon the whole, i am much pleased with him

 "having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority
 lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age
 "i have every reason in the world to think ill of you
 the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this
 his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself
 mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card
 "for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness
 but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company
 she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost
 this however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors
 you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it
 on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks
" miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives
 she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night
 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected
 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations
 but i have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world
" "how can you contrive to write so even?" he was silent
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word

" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted
 i know not what to think
 when a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
 but the case is this
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever
" "mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?" "no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat
 she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise
--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections
 with _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where
 but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself
 jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day
 but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband
 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits
 we passed each other several times
" "_that_ you certainly shall
 they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants
 nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant
 he added, that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and promised to write again very soon
 you know my sentiments
 mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together
 as yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness
 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse
 if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention

 that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion
 on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place
 there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well
 every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections
 she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done
 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine
 however, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves
" "we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit
" "and do you really know all this?" cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive
 as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room
" "do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share
 i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, william collins
" "yes, she did
 having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane
" "it is no such thing
 lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford
 it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner

 both changed colour, one looked white, the other red
 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city
" "which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men
 you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt
 my child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life
 one came from her books, and the other from her toilette
 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home
 as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to
 you have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule
 as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination
 mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker

" "and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject

" "well, then, you need not be under any alarm

" "thank you--but i always mend my own
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else
 she was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented
" "very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say
" "i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind
 one seems so forlorn without them
 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her
 nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole
 [illustration: matlock] pride and prejudice: a novel
 such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite
 "eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds
" "yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible
 it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers
 i would go and see her, if i could have the carriage
" elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her

 the business was therefore soon settled
--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay
" she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, "come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room
" and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing
 her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard
" "then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr bingley to _her_
 but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited
 all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes
 but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice
 elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself
 it will pass away soon enough
 i am perfectly serious in my refusal
 elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them

 i know your disposition, lizzy

 georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved
 but, really, i know not what to say
 i do not believe she often sees such at home
 my temper would perhaps be called resentful
 i have not been used to submit to any person's whims
" elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first
" "i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
 we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon
 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them
 her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage

 chapter i
 the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them
 but slyness seems the fashion
 they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign
 she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him
" "i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women
 but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished
 her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms
" "i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers
 we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home
 and his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
 i will put on my things in a moment
" this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate
 his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature
 mamma would like to go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" "yes," thought elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once
 "about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand
" "ah! sir, i do indeed
 when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small
--pardon me
 "nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair
" and she rose as she spoke
" "i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen
" "heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me such an evil
 "it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
 you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance
 "and pray may i ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials
" "and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?" "i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship
 chapter xix
 she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise
 but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud
 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement
 a person may be proud without being vain
 she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable
 the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him
 "e
 the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary
 "you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" "lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say
 wretched, wretched, mistake!" darcy made no answer
 but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king
 besides, there was truth in his looks
 i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind
 make haste, make haste
" "you must not blame my aunt
 i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed
 mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed
" "you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling
 she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her
 she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her
 and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?" "you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered
" "perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all
" chapter xiii
" "are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way
 if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however
" "whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes
 were it for nothing but his love of you, i must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me
--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
 he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded
 but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness
 so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs
" elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately
 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could
 is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very ill
" "no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on
 she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend
" "very well
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter
 "how abominable!--i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it
_ _engraved for no
" "you are quite right
 "and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?" "i will make no promise of the kind
" "_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet
 a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh, lord! what will become of me
 how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?" "hate you! i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction
 never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her
 it is impossible that he should still love me
 there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable
 i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses
 with his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning
 i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command
) "well, so much the better
 a clear ten thousand per annum
 nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts

 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing
 "wickham so very bad! it is almost past belief
 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same
 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here
 after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball
 but she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife
 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion
--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear

 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller
" "the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so
 they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable
 he shall not be in love with me, if i can prevent it
 i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment
" when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short
" "already arisen!" repeated mr bennet
 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed
 what shall we do with him? lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's way
" "money! my uncle!" cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?" "i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am gone
 the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport
 her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness
 i thought i should have died
" "we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago
 "he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them

 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain
 "i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried
 elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself
 "now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself
 their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach
 the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty
 "and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" "i hope not
" and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house

" "my motive for cautioning you, is as follows
 james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look
 they will ruin your happiness
 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information
 darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them
 "this will not do," said elizabeth
" "i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want

" "yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life
 "lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these
 the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter
 on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former
 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness
 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning

" "i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness
 at that moment, she cared for no other
--i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason
 they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought
 but it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again
 mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party
 don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side
" "if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it
 she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness
 i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst's gown----" here she was interrupted again
 eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress
 the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever
 the latter was thinking only of his breakfast
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected
 she is not such a simpleton
" wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, "you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right
" "gracechurch-street, monday, august 2
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure
 i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?" "why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear
--but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference
 he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it
 his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go
 as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more
 indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear
 besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight
 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it
 she approached, and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece
 if i was to go through the world, i could not meet with a better
" "you are severe on us
 one ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! but it was not to be
 but with _me_, it is not so
" "kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill
 but that gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all
 it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs
 calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly
 how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell
" "indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother
7
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough
 my aunt told me so herself on saturday
 she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house
" "i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do
 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names
 not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power
" "oh!" cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable
 but, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt
 they had frequently been staying with her in town
" mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character
 her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us
 mrs bennet's best comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense
 it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked
 this cannot be!--engaged to mr darcy! no, no, you shall not deceive me
 but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
" mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way
 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters
 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should be deceived again
 once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear
 she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns
" "and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he know his real character?" "i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did
 she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years
" "her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament
 elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time
 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise
 our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly
 mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects
" "i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly
" "i had much rather go in the coach
 he never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior
 the motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him
 how is such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have not the smallest hope
 and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined

 no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called
" "let me be rightly understood
 any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far
 the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging
 we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye
 she answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, "my eldest sister has been in town these three months
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?" "i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet
 jane was not happy
 it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you
" "no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical
" "i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him
 he was well, but so much engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him
--but _now_ we may be silent
" but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters
 as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner
" chapter xxi
" "did not you? _i_ did for you
" she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house
 but you have chosen your fault well
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
 the next was in these words
 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty
" "_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it
" elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce
" elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate
 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i despair
 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly
 every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch
 you are not going to be _missish_, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report
" "yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one
 her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable
 i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family
 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you
 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i assure you there are many amiable young women
 he has more to give
 "_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly
 but you do not know _all_
 i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off
 jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?" "yes, i have had a letter from him by express
" "i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am _not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more
 elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning
 he comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday
 with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you say that he was at rosings?" "nearly three weeks
" "and what arts did he use to separate them?" "he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling
 "i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal
" on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at pemberley
" "oh! it is of no consequence
 he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room
 i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_

 for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse
 she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it
 when she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer
 she practises very constantly

" "is that his design in settling here?" "design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes

 her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank

 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_
--here you are in your own family
 but, lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or jane at most
 the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia

 he had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress
" "you cannot be too much on your guard
 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived
 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon
 yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here
 after an affectionate parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown
 she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day

 the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening
--other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons

 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week

--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless

 she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse
 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter

 it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go
 he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere
 my mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she says
 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all
 elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased
" "and what did she say?" "that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well

 intending to trace their route
 as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister
 chapter ix
 the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature
 "what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!" she cried
 in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry
--it was an animating subject, and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match
 some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages

 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress
 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste
--on this subject i have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed
 "he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention
" "well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him

 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her
 respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown
 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him
 they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing to him
 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure
 elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view
 "who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "his misfortunes!" repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed

 "i see your design, bingley," said his friend

 "while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr bingley

 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself
 clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in that parish
 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable
f
 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street
 but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me
 she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family
 at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other

 it was all pride and insolence
 i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me
--oh! had i known what i ought, what i dared, to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too much
 in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other
" "if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
 stay, stay, i will go myself
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret
 elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband
 it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit
" "i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself
 there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste
 every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites
 is it true?" elizabeth replied that it was
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share
 redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam
 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family
 such very superior dancing is not often seen
 they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve
 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room
" "i do not think we were speaking at all
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
 the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more
 in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters
--elizabeth's courage did not fail her
 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible
" in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it
 all was joy and kindness
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous
 his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother
" "i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character
 he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting
 she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what
" "that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly
" "i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully
 "and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose
" elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case
 they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them
 "what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear
 with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations
 "wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane's
 yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of
--you could not make _me_ happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so
 chapter xii
 "yes--if darcy does not put it off again
 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one
 "do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham
 mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off
 "it keeps him in good humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express
 she certainly did not hate him
--i will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection
 are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject
--i told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word
 it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity
 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all
" "beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing
 let her go then
 you know not what you are about
 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude
 you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal
--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison
 let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her
" "i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked
 lady catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance
 through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance
 wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish

" "my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now
" "i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion
 it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked up
--but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day
 one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
 brother-in-law of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection
" "to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum
" "and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books
 but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character
 she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject
 i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state
 i do not deserve it
" jane shook her head
 they have at least that advantage
" "i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife
 mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once
 but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything
 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so
 it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor
 every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable
 "your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet
 i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely
 happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!" "i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power
 "in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was
 i cannot understand it
 what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening
 james's
 not that i care about it, though
--mr bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase
 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former
 mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth, "miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn
 came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice
 miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to _your_ family
 it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham
 he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed
 yours ever, "caroline bingley
 it is mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army
 "but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it
" "if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy

 from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them
" "it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_
 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out
 the moral will be perfectly fair
 "i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her
 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit
 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth: "my dearest lizzy, "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday
 and when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man
" darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again
 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes
" as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth
" "perfectly so--i thank you
 you must send john with the young ladies, mrs collins
 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies
" "my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence
 well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him
 they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight
 i wonder what he can be doing there
 there is nothing he would not do for her
" he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away
 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them
 lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable
 if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him
 whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
 he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend
" the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days
 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself
 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity
 the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin
' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time
 mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him
 could there be finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt
 "'tis too much!" she added, "by far too much
" "la!" replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before
 he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "just as you please
e
" he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself
" "and i certainly _never_ shall give it
 he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; charlotte tried to console her
 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp

 they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day
 on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time
 "lizzy, you must not do so
" mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter
" "mr darcy!" repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement
 he was angry
 no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home
 i wish i could see her
 chapter xv
 chapter xvii
 she could think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right
--my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me
 let us hope for better things
 within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day
--it was kindly meant
 they met again on sunday, and then _i_ saw him too
 he was full of joy and attention
 on both sides it was only assertion
 this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it
 mr wickham began the subject himself
--kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed
 i will speak to her about it myself directly
" "oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with
 as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence
 easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be important
 good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for
--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it
 but i must write no more
 you are lucky in having such a master
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry
 his words seemed to imply it
" "you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy
 but enough of this
 her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome
 they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it
 while in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?" "yes, and i had heard it before
 they walked on, without knowing in what direction
" mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister
 "by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent
 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt
 the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon
 long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided
 at present we have nothing to guide us
 it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's
" "oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared
" "i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design," said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery
--at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on
" "undoubtedly
 mr darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours
" miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere
 if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not hope it
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes
 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him
 it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour
 "do you certainly leave kent on saturday?" said she
" he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long
 lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer
 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!" "i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire
 and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and mrs long
 darcy said nothing at all
 on saturday he came again
" "but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model
 the others have been gone on to scarborough, these three weeks
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_
" "i should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother
 on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion
 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted
 there was no arguing upon such a project
 he cannot afford it
 "of what are you talking?" "of mr collins and lizzy
 if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all
 can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart
 my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church
 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her
 she enquired after his sister, but could do no more
 his character was decided
 i only hope they may have half my good luck

 lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way
 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh
 kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters
" "_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_

 it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you
 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself
 his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away
 where shall you change horses?--oh! bromley, of course
 miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance
 of his former way of life, nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year
 it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy
" "my dear, you flatter me
 it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial
 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit
 "this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said mrs bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own
 mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner
" "but consider your daughters
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it
" it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane
" "no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once
 mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education
 when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections
 she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her
 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy
--i must be in town next saturday
 his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again
 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer
 _you_ cannot have been always at longbourn
--but no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them
 he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me
 mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself
 haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week
 it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley, and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea
" mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_
" "though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit
 all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the london road
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner
 when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain
" "were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park
 what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
 it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals
 she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour
 he has children of his own, and may have more
 my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers
 he did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september, than any body else in the country
 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology
 chapter iii
" she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?" "i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future
" "i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more
" "certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am not one of _them_
 such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! it is really too distressing
 mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements
 it was all conjecture
 she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself
" on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away

 at last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance
 that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations
 she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend
 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness
 i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's regard
 elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion
 mr jones says we must not think of moving her
" "if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine
 the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful
 but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange
 at length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends
" "unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often do
 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more
 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable
 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling
 chapter vii
 she declared her resolution
 but that is not the case _here_
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry
 dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's
 it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them
 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday
 "there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?" the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it
 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere
--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much
" "in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either
 they are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines
" "it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud
 for such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey
 they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture
 mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months
 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect
 in confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on
 you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner
 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour
 if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go
" "pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end, and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary
 you have sense, and we all expect you to use it
 but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last
" "but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit
 "lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? have not you always hated him?" how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to mr darcy
--when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been
 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty
" "i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage
 jane was so admired, nothing could be like it
 hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort
 i shall see her in january
 in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite
 steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her
 her answer was warmly in his favour
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him
 she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids
 we have not met since the 26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield
 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone
 i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him
 elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight
 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone
 it will save me a world of trouble and economy
 the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible
" "we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said elizabeth
 i am afraid you will be angry
 we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips
 he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday
" "she did indeed, louisa
 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know
 yes, miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all
--"oh! mr collins!"-- "my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point
 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
 1
 mr collins then returned to elizabeth
 the happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do
 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it
 but no one can throw any blame on them
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered
" "indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me
 let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance
 but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew
" in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley
 it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening
 till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her
 he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it
 1
 mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
 you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms
 elizabeth immediately began playing again
 to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough
 be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business
 the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn
 she then took a large house in edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings
" darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right
 my good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last
 oh! why is not every body as happy?" elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express
 among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous
 she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the gate
--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay
 the possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred
 he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly
 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and monday, endurable to kitty and lydia
 regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge
 there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance
 however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent
 she resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family
--i hope there was
 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me
" "this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree
 "i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak
" "we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply
 every body is disgusted with his pride
 it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast
 miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him
 lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention
" "have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?" "oh! yes
 she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage
" "what, none of you?" "not one
 no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation
 miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present
 i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding
 "but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be brought to reason
 i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject
 but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are
 her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds
 mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure
 she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times
" "but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt
 to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing
" "you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
 i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun
 in three volumes
 my aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing
 "it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before
 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone
" "i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_ should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia
 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together
" "your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof
 and if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large
" "that is right

 hear me in silence
 laws alone swamp our small staff
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them
 mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart
--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome
 it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind
 any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm license as specified in paragraph 1
" "i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried elizabeth
 "indeed, jane, you ought to believe me
" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage
 all was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation
 "there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match
 "mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman
 in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief
 elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr wickham and herself
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family
--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point
" "oh! shocking!" cried miss bingley
 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter
 but, however, he is very welcome to come to netherfield, if he likes it
f
 my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be
" "if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think
 he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business
 the subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away
" "you have
 as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was
e
 but we are all liable to error
 i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!" to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures
" "aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself
" "thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me
 when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so
 "your's sincerely, &c
" "lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use

 in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend
 miss darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed
 _my_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever
 at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular
e
 in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation
 she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you
 had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it
 with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable
 when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth
 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected
" "what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr darcy had much better finish his letter
" "compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made
 they are gone down to newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not know how long
 by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary
 poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful
 "it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth
" mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do
 she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge
" "it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends
 elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well
 it cannot be concealed from any one
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy
 and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age
 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man
 five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would
 to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others

 pray read on
" "and have you heard from him often?" "we have heard only once
 dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed
 all field sports were over
 they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream
 the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on
" "in what an amiable light does this place him!" thought elizabeth
 you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much
 she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother
 he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her
 they were to be off as soon as possible
" "if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?" "i never heard that it was
--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made
 oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" wickham, lydia, were all forgotten
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman
" "not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise
 "and is this all?" cried elizabeth
 "i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
" "not as you represent it
" to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
" "yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood
 "when i consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew what he was
--"i, who have prided myself on my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust
" "so much the better
 but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand
 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character
 his surprise was great
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm
 mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her
 but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you are satisfied
 human nature is so prone to fall into it! no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame
 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing
" elizabeth could bear it no longer
 _that_ is all settled
" "what think you of books?" said he, smiling
 does she live near you, sir?" "the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship's residence
 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent
 charlotte did not stay much longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard
 it is highly improper
" "indeed!" cried wickham with a look which did not escape her
" "you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth
 you have delighted us long enough
" "nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of humility
 jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected
 "my dear brother, "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction
--your's, &c
" "but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him
 "i never heard any thing so abominable
 i promised them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret!" "if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the subject
" "and i have another favour to ask
 that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate
 and, above all things, keep mr bennet from fighting
 unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own
 and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say
 my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you write for me
 colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman
 elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect
 his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others
 i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley
 if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem
" "but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required
 charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe
--they had several children
 anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn
 only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time
" "well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away
 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations
 chapter iii
" "i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail
 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as jane
 chapter v
 what a fine thing for our girls!" "how so? how can it affect them?" "my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
--she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility
" "good god! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner
 you see on what a footing we are
--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear
 he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all
 mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before
 after this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her
 "and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! oh, that i knew how it was!" but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour
" elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat
 he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable house
 by nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at st
" "what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town
 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself
" "how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself
 the party did not supply much conversation
 they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved
 they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for mr darcy
 he readily agreed to it
 i think i have heard you say that you know them
 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her
 elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant
 he owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable
" "how should you have liked making sermons?" "exceedingly well
 her report was highly favourable
 what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know
 as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion
 i hate such false friends
" "you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition
 mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere
 but mr gardiner could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning
 he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances
" "do you suppose them to be in london?" "yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" "and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice
 you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last
 his principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham
 "i should never have said mrs collins was settled _near_ her family
 "you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time
 by many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song
 not one party, or scheme, or any thing
 and so, you like this man's sisters too, do you? their manners are not equal to his
 bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected
 he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia once
 chapter xvii
 but these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design
 it was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it
 but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone
 i have no such injuries to resent
 mrs hurst thought the same, and added, "she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker
 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance
 she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again
 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him
 what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion
 at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband
--i desire you will stay where you are
 i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life
 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing
" "you need not distress yourself
 that lady i suppose is your mother
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i think it will be very tolerable
 elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy
 you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done for the young people
 if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen
 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and miss bingley
 charlotte the wife of mr collins, was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen
" "why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned
 a thousand things may arise in six months!" the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt
" she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success
--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family
 it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn
 you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it
 his understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes
 they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose
 "i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her
 "well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what say you to the day? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, i assure you
 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
 he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on
 they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune
 his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile
 since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head
 "i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
 mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it
 come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly
 he still loves me, and we are engaged
 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
 such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued absence
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us
 but will they make you happy?" "have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" "none at all
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself
 "not at all
 how shall we punish him for such a speech?" "nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth
 far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter
 it will not do
 what a stroke was this for poor jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it
 your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather
 mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride
 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great
 she had very little notice from any but him
 his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion
 mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day
 "i am sure there is not on _his_
 "oh! my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball
 but they did pass away, and mr and mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn
 "i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness
 in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account
" "but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about
 "come here, child," cried her father as she appeared
" "i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy, "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before
e
 i am sick of them all
 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters
 they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to
" elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation
 every body said how well she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice
 it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours
" "i know them a little
 mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her
--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it
" "these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth
 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" "oh, yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i tell you all
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations
 mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself
 her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you
 you must learn some of my philosophy
" "i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied
 her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
" "not the slightest
 lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it
 she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry
 she went on
" "i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity
" "you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money
--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern
" "your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was all lost upon me
 it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has never seen the view
 it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before
 not that i am afraid of _myself_, but i dread other people's remarks
5
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected
 she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents
" this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine
" elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance
 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all
 you must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what i say
" "nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled
" mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments
 it was really a very handsome thought
 i see the imprudence of it
 she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family
 the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted
 every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight
 with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged
" "we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and lydia
 console lady catherine as well as you can
 elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home
 "i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips
" "it is difficult indeed--it is distressing
 jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears
 "but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable
 "you have insulted me, in every possible method
 mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise
 mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight
 i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_
 and _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter
the project gutenberg ebook, pride and prejudice, by jane austen, edited by r
" "i should be sorry indeed, if it were
 thank heaven! i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him
 she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another
 there was no help for it however
 in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference
6
 she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on
" "upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield
" "and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him
 anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil
 four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
 she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave
" the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual
 i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose
" upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock
 to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
" elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match
 it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us
 lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy
 i saw them the night before last
 "oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know
" elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off
 society, i own, is necessary to me
 "when is your next ball to be, lizzy?" "to-morrow fortnight
 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him
 her ladyship was highly incensed
 "my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way
 he really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger
 he does not want abilities
 by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
 forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante
 they have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better
" "that is not very likely; our authority was too good
 well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day
 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply
 mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street
 with a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed
" "it is more than i engage for, i assure you
 "my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table
 there was another reason too for her opposition
 limited warranty, disclaimer of damages - except for the "right of replacement or refund" described in paragraph 1
 before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge
" "pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing i believe
 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way
 i am prodigiously proud of him
 in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness
 _he_ was exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no fresh pain
 i cannot think so very ill of wickham
 if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this
" "care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care
"--and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr collins
" "certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger
" "our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
 i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy
 she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr darcy, she was directly retreating
 will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight
 "i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason
 they were able to love each other, even as well as they intended
 "but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle
--mr collins must excuse me
 but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding
" "i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer
 how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly
 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children
--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read
" jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness
 mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable
" "that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily
 the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground
" "i see no occasion for that
" mr bennet's expectations were fully answered
 he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits
 it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions
 i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way
 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem
 miss lucas is married and settled
--daughters are never of so much consequence to a father
--i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner
 we want none of them; do we?" darcy had walked away to another part of the room
 adieu
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood
 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her
 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced
 its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable
" "your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it
 this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving
 "why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure

 i am going away myself
--young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life
 and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?" to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it
 but who was your mother? who are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition
 upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself
 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_
 _i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united

 her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous
 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility
 she answered him with cold civility
 but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it
 i grieve to find, however, that colonel f
 bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter
 mr collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give
 i was sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her
 "i am, dear sir, &c
" "laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion
 a lively imagination soon settled it all
 "could i expect it to be otherwise!" said she
" "he is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings
 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
 you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert
 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return
" then shewing her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet
 i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better
 i congratulate her
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject
 but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was
 on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "let me call your maid
 elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes
 "he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?" elizabeth looked archly, and turned away
 to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley
1 through 1
 from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea
" "it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this winter
" "an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth
 i do not know who is good enough for him
 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand
 chapter ii
 their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush
 she studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different
--he wrote last week to hurry my return
 as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner:-- "you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither
 jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all
 he has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one
--these causes must be stated, though briefly
 she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome
 i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel
 lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation
 what is your own opinion?" "that it ought not to be attempted
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give
 s
" "there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him
 mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way
 the comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression
 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition
" "my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london
 i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother
 at such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward
 conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none
 "oh! lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! if i could but see _you_ as happy! if there _were_ but such another man for you!" "if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as you

 it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning
 "it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country
 do not imagine, miss bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified
 "well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me
 let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you

 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained
 oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him
 mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away
 when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument
 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go

 he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done
" "whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_
 i do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body better looking
 "to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection
" "how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness
 mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance
 and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it
 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again
 an airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure
 and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater beauty
" "no, no, nonsense, lizzy
 secondly, that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness

 but at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey
 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it
 it seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her
 but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years
 but i can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
 but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate
 the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow
 i will only add, god bless you
 pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance
 mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his
 "i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter!" "la! my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady catherine

 you deserve no such attention
 elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings
 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me
 as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence
 they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about
" "i certainly shall not
 she was ashamed to think how much

" "that is to say, you had given your permission
 and i think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's
 mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase
 recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
 and mrs forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny, and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least
 at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken
 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way
 when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning
 she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all
 "believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections
 they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound
" "in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well

 but now it was all too natural
 we can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement
 she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found
 "are you not diverted?" "oh! yes
 to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened
 at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
" "i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at pemberley
 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any consideration
 "my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?" mr bennet replied that he had not
 the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten
 she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success
" "what is his name?" "bingley
 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood
 "how could you begin?" said she

 now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, "mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's
 on this subject, what can you have to say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"

--it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family
 mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire
 their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him
 there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well
 four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her
 it was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance
 her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it
 _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is
 but no such recollection befriended her
 there was no want of discourse
 when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention

" again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification
 mr bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself

 in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself
 mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "this walk is not wide enough for our party
 "i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
 "i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object

" "but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered
 you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it
--there is something very pompous in his style
 if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me
 such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon
" elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner!" "we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care
" darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject
" "indeed you are mistaken
" "i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening
 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune
 "we can all plague and punish one another
" "caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter
" "at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter
 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour
" elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself
 her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious
" with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself
 i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient
 nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states
 she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her
 who would have thought she could be so thin and small!" "she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind
" "do you really think so?" cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment
 a few weeks, he believed
 jane was by no means better
 _you_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection
 if i have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them

 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory
 she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself
 that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with mr gardiner
" "but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their marriage be private? oh! no, no, this is not likely
 the officers will find women better worth their notice
 nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy
" "yes; he introduced us to his sister
 they soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind
" and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house
" "could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife?" "he brought it with him for us to see
 i have a high respect for your nerves
 that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!" "i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her
 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford

" "yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it
" "but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied darcy
 "i have sent for you on an affair of importance
 if i may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud
 any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it, if you had rather not
 after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah! jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman

 but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?" "they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine
 "i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news
 what relates to yourself, is as follows
 from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him
 but, lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it
" elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion
--what a delightful library you have at pemberley, mr darcy!" "it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations
 her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "there are very few people of whom so much can be said
 elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole
 mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone mr collins began
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections
 they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain
" "but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him
" to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting
 first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed
" "this is not to be borne

 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal
 nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister

 it convinced her, that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town
 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this
" "i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
 now is your time
 jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening
" mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment
 i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him
 my feelings will not be repressed
 stop me whilst you can
" "oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?" but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters
" "has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
 my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made
 we now come to the point
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! her aunt now called her to look at a picture
 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr bennet coolly observed, "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country
 had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?" as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued

" "from mr collins! and what can _he_ have to say?" "something very much to the purpose of course
 "pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel fitzwilliam
 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_
 this was very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed
 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom
 "i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her
--how humiliating is this discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind
 indeed he has no improper pride
 "my dear niece, "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with
 "indeed i have, sir," was her answer
 elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes
" "you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir
" "i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing
 "i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away
 he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal
 the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work
 i came to try you
" "you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
 the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property
 every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time
 when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn
 "i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north
 "what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him
 his doing so drew her notice
 they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance
 she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy
 you shall hear what she says
" "true
 in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin
 she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
" "you shall have it in few words
" "but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out
" "when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other
" "oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you
 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it
 but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled
 he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months
" "they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters

 "if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for
 and so, is it quite certain he is coming?" "you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true
 mr what's his name
 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c
" elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room
 but against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered
 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly
" darcy mentioned his letter
 they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks
 let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence
 his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her
 his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! oh! it must be my uncle's doings! generous, good man, i am afraid he has distressed himself
 you _are_ a gentleman's daughter
 * * * * * "good gracious!" cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company
 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible
 he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things
 elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked
" "what should not you mind?" "i should not mind any thing at all
" "dear lizzy!" "oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general
 thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business
" kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry
" "i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time
 she received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice
 but i know the foundation is unjust
" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner
 i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy
" lydia declared herself satisfied
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations
e
" miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room
 but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion
 i want to talk very seriously
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene
 elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course
" "this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west
" "upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person
 i cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as i often see done
 and there was my aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon
 the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?" "when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same
 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks
 her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious
 now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits
--neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane
 i must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music
 i am glad he dines here on tuesday
 all connection between us seemed now dissolved
" "well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley, and under your orders
" "have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out
 it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one
 i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing
 she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe
 it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble
 elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation
 elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away
" during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening
 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see
 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time
 as for their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters
 "but how did he account for it?" "it must have been his sister's doing
 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together
 "she is a great deal too ill to be moved
" when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason
 "my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me
 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away
 "excuse my interference
 _i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me
 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly
 the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
 "haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful
 at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave
 sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before
" "now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to table
 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered
 at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable
 but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
 my feelings in every respect forbid it
 "i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball
" "had you then persuaded yourself that i should?" "indeed i had
 it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was
 when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, "do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel
 chapter ix
 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately
 lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars
 but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her
 "oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately
" "and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?" "yes; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it
 during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation
 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over
 i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married
" "tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, "i am not
 in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off
" "i must not decide on my own performance
 there was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies
 i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong
 "then, who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess you must have been neglected
 elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another
 it is a pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend
 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman
 the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy
 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house
" "oh! but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs
 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers
 "he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible
 "there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way
 she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found
 here, sarah, come to miss bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown
 she dared not even mention that gentleman
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn
" elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family
 mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent
 the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her
