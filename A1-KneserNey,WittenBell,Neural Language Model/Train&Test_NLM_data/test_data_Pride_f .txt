 mr bennet protested against any description of finery
 it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration
--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word
 on entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided

 but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched
 my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr wickham

 lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough
 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight
 much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married
 find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her
 he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister
 i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being

" mr bingley arrived
 "come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance
 of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing
 "how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be thankful

 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede
 when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party
 "two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge
 he _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey
 poor dear child! and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration
 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence
 "not yet," replied jane
 she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself
 thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves
 my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself
 mr bennet could not have chosen better
" "go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks
 she could think only of her letter
 thank god! i have not _that_ pain
 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas
 he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings
" "removed!" cried bingley
" "yes, sir, i know i am
 "it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me
 "my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible
" "mr darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again

 miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth

 only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage
 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month
" "did charlotte dine with you?" "no, she would go home
 they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration
 mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton
 they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone
 the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster, the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described
 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side
 allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy
 you must and shall be married by a special licence
 mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep
 there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much

 this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so
 "i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends
 but as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you
 well! i am so happy
 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's
 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help
" "i am afraid you do not like your pen
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor
 elizabeth, on her side, had much to do
--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
 in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he wants you in the library
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book
" her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day
 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste
 his plan did not vary on seeing them
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless
 "how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there
" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation
 not these two or three years perhaps
 her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it
 chapter xviii
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up
" "no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did
 it was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground
 elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph
 nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct
 i can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _i_ have seen nothing of it
" "very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
 but now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage
 but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet
 chapter iii
 its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned
" elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative
" "to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart
 after sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth, "i hope you are well, miss bennet
" "oh! my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for
 lydia, my love, ring the bell
 with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee
" "aye--that is because you have the right disposition
 i will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn
 it was hardly enough; but it pleased her
 mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party
 but you know married women have never much time for writing
" "you are then resolved to have him?" "i have said no such thing
 no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village
 but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i could
 and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment
 but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice
--"louisa, you will not mind my waking mr hurst
 her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace
 colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings
 could he expect that her friends would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is not adequate to the risk
 they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought
 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one
 he will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before
 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country
 but she would not be secure
 lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs forster
 jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from caroline
 "but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for
 mr collins made his declaration in form
 accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me
 she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so
 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object
" "all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading
 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia
 "john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?" "yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement
 their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten
 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st
 "he must be an oddity, i think," said she
" "it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are
 they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy, were to entertain each other
--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
 colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise
" "aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love
 i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been
" jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante
 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight
 "'tis an etiquette i despise," said he
 this is my advice
 mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley
 if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment
 royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4, "information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation
 i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would i give to hear your strictures on them!" "your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps
" "certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world
 when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?" "nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning
 an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley
" "has your governess left you?" "we never had any governess
" "is he married or single?" "oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home
 for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body
 "his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment
 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! no, no--i feel he may defy us there
 "he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? if he fears me, why come hither? if he no longer cares for me, why silent? teazing, teazing, man! i will think no more about him
 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure
 they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room
 he was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty
" "if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement
 though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here
 but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton, these visitors came
 but what does he say of the living?" "he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only
 mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless
 my reasons for believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable
 "and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted! instead of viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt
 "i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he
 i need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable
 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it
1
" "pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state
 he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me
 lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go with her
" elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs
--will you hear it?" "most willingly
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her
 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected
' she did indeed
" "i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other
--i am excessively attentive to all those things
--many stared
 promise me, therefore, to come to hunsford
 the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense
 you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it
 it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before
" "_that_ is a failing indeed!"--cried elizabeth
" this was invitation enough
" her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented
 you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at pemberley with you
 she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means
 "there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night
" "and do you like her?" "very much
 mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of
 let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner
 but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined
 "so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find
 "i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled
 your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged
" she replied in the affirmative
 the officer was the very mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed
 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet
 end of the second volume
 in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence
 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters
 "yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost
" "this account then is what he has received from mr darcy
" "this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced
 all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil
f
f
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them
 "i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring
 as a child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my temper
 miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former
 her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much
 but i confess they would have no charms for _me_
 but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief
 in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam
 i am very glad you liked her
 he was very fond of them
 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you must marry
 you alluded to something else
--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man
 ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton
 her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them
 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied
 "tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's
" "pray tell your sister that i long to see her
 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression
--"a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr bingley i am sure
 when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him
 "yes, she called yesterday with her father
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy
 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt
 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn
 the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship
 but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands
 but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the room
 her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it
 howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair
 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence
 "of music! then pray speak aloud
" "i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?" "she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property
 "do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_
 after a short silence, the lady first spoke
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel
 at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her
" miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully
 they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered
 a flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite
 chapter i
" "do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?" "it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
" wickham only shook his head
" "insolent girl!" said elizabeth to herself
--_that_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter
 "it must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year
 there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself
" "yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing
 she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation
 to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself
 they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens
 their table was superlatively stupid
 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham
 sir william did not say much
 mr bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house
 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected
 i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together
 i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter
" "i am talking of possibilities, charles
 "and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more than i ever look into
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour
 he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women
 any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed
" "how strange!" cried elizabeth
 at present i will say nothing about it
 as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her, saying, "i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself
 you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these
 mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family
 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent
" "i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two
 girls, can i do any thing for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill
 your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us
 it was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to
 we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode
--no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection
 "does that young lady know mr darcy?" elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little
 it would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two
" "i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him
 but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad he is gone
 assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable
 must it be so?" "oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that

 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met
 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
 "now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy
 mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state
 you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming
" "it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty
 he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning
 "she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible
 they were, therefore, to go
 lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites
 * * * * * in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme
 his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion
 their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence
 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him
 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced only four dances! i am sorry to pain you--but so it was
 london: printed for t
--he is his own master
 my dear hill, have you heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding
 but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me
 nobody wants him to come
 everything wore a happier aspect
" "yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly
" thursday was to be the wedding day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room
--but there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me
 i guessed as much
 i expected you to stay two months
 "a place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected
 in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels
 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance
 she was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family
 he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably
 she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
 "my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" "there can be no doubt of that
 his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal
 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters
 "my dear, dear lydia!" she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage every thing
 when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them
 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking
 and so would anne, if her health had allowed her to apply
" elizabeth could not but look surprised
" "much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball
 he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump
 mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well
" "i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age
 "i do not get on at all
 the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike
 and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject
 mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man
 i am the happiest creature in the world
 1
" "all!--what, all five out at once? very odd!--and you only the second
 a lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment
 i hope they will not meet at all
" and gravely glancing at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i shall keep mine to swell my song
 but lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me
 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned
" he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said
 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences
 you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty
 they were natural and just
 when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time
" "lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent
" the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair
 "good heaven! what is to become of us! what are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur
 she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents
 when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment
 such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly
 "the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved in civility

 the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother
 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic
 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment
 and with no one to speak to, of what i felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had! oh! how i wanted you!" "how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved
 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself
" "you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence
 all that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum
 their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country
 but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen
 but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance
 let me do it without farther loss of time
 my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it
 but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
 balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters
" "your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you
 i send no compliments to your mother
" then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon
 i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point
--it now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors
 she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way
" "what do you mean?" "why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley
" "certainly not
 what i have to say relates to poor lydia
" and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character
 you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves
" "the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt
 this, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better
 in understanding darcy was the superior
" "but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure
 he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could
--perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones
 let me hear from you very soon
 i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable
 i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that i _should_ be looked at
 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first
 i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing
 from their infancy, they have been intended for each other
 "i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham
 but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err
 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson; did not i mention it to you? mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question--oh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point
 you and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the party
 they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence
 to pemberley, therefore, they were to go
" "i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper
 "and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?" said mr gardiner
 mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it
" chapter vi
 widely different was the effect of a second perusal
 it was only said, 'lately, george wickham, esq
 a low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing
e
 lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself
 "i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town
 "they will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters
 he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided
" "with the officers!" cried lydia
 mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was
 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them
 i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park
 i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
 "she looks sickly and cross
 "if he wants our society, let him seek it
 his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year
 remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin
 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother
 "what, has she frightened away some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down
 first of all, he asked miss lucas
" "i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night
 i know no harm of her
 elizabeth went away with her head full of him
" "and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i thank you for explaining it so fully
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
" "his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it
 if you are a good girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of them
 but mrs bennet, was not so well pleased with it
 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks
 of course, we hope that you will support the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with the work
 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable
 mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet
 you know i have
 on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery
 chapter xix
 "we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell!" elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal
 there could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence
 if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight
 send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life
 he seldom appeared really animated
 his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire
" "an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles
 "i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places
 what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room
 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured
 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself
" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex
 a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation
" mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how
 you have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him
 they were hopeless of remedy
 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse
 the express was sent off directly
 elizabeth silently attended her
 the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them
 how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?" "if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has not sixpence of his own
 good bye
 for what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "oh!" cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted
 she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they took place
 1
 as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house
 but let me advise you to think better of it
 i hope she will turn out well
 they came
 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt
" mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication
 but it is of small importance
 much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of _you_
 we were married, you know, at st
 mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other
 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness
" "probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses
 i enquired after their brother, of course
 she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there
 my friend has an excellent understanding--though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did
 the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch
 we will go round the park every day
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at present i have not room to do them justice
 he placed himself by her
 our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character
 there can be no love in all this
" mr and mrs gardiner smiled
 bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them
" she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held
 elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth
 "_you_ were mr bingley's first choice
 her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little
 my dear jane, mr collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking

--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect
" mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not return it
 you never see a fault in any body
 it is of all subjects my delight
 she liked him too little to care for his approbation
 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more
 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, "i can guess the subject of your reverie
 we had better not mention it
 elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name
 "i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers
" she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse
 they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister
 at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house
 the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family
 those who do not complain are never pitied
 i know we dine with four and twenty families
 presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on
" "his manners are very different from his cousin's
 till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance
 "we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall
 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over
 its completion depended on others
 after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses
" "certainly
 i am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty
 she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance
 you shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness
 on distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities
 their powers of conversation were considerable
 it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success
 at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head quarters
 her reflections were in general satisfactory
 you may have drawn him in
 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" "what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"--said jane as she finished it
" "_you_ observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition

 the first week of their return was soon gone
 she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished
 as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on
 two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day
 after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men
 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn
 "his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner
 my dear lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us
" "you may depend upon my not mentioning it
 she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible
" "_mr darcy_, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_ surprised you
 that is the place to get husbands
" "no, indeed, i did not
 they shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself
 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon
" "i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it
" "oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister
 elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it
 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical
 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited
 tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day
 why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley
 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks

 mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year
 accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer
 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage
--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley
 you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being created_

 "project gutenberg" is a registered trademark
 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity
' allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer
" "it was a subject which they could not mention before me
 with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart
 lord! how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls
" "indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary
 she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it
 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
" he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling
" the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit
 "is miss darcy much grown since the spring?" said miss bingley; "will she be as tall as i am?" "i think she will
" "undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation
 he replied, and was again silent
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills
--nor did that day wear out her resentment
 your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, i am sure
 iii
 he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within
 i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection
 mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting
--do not you, darcy?" "my style of writing is very different from yours
 poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention
 she is almost three and twenty! lord, how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think
" "she will drop the acquaintance entirely
 i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony
" every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away
 the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham
 elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long
 elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend
 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance
 he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him
 from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help

 she looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns
 "what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there is nothing like dancing after all
 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much
 but mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before
 my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "oh! jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "i do not know
 from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent
 his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him
 but however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so
" "all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?" "yes, all of them, i think
" "aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one

" their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days
 jane was distressed
 a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little
" "yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever
 but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule
 i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in mrs jenkinson's room
" "well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose
" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him
--we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice
 he drew a chair near her

 her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself
" elizabeth almost stared at her
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself
 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth
" "was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was ill at netherfield?" "dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it by all means
 mrs bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!" "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he
" "i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise
 they must all go to brighton
 they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight
--if it be so, if i have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable
 how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them
 she respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses
" "and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day's journey
 at our time of life, it is not so pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
 to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit
" * * * * * it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey
 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence
 when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son
 he was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, "i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_ a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit
 this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming
 if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon
 mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast
 well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted
 why should they try to influence him? they can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it
 my father bears it better
 while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her
" "to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you

" "and they _must_ marry! yet he is _such_ a man!" "yes, yes, they must marry
 mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility
" mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward
" mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well
 they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade

 "lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living
" "you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan
 that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy
 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare
 i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy
 he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily
" "no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing

" she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two
 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas
 "well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to say
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing
 its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn

 you dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind
 after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display
" "my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother
 it was then disclosed in the following manner
 i am sorry to say it of them, but so it is
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner
 i could hardly keep my countenance
 the rector of a parish has much to do
 mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected
 "but so we all do
 she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition
 had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned
 when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte
--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection
 to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he _did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr robinson

--you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you
 his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections
 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
 she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself
 though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to you
 "it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire
 mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding
 they are not married, nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side, i hope it will not be long before they are

 how does georgiana get on, darcy?" mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency
 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham's attentions
 kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment
 sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance

" and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together
 after a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud
 it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were assembled
" and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace
 the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome
 at length the parsonage was discernible
" "i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil? but i have other provocations
" "is it possible!" cried elizabeth, when she had finished
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business

 her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her
--she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce

 the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly
 "they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all
 "well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane's? for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody
 "yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor
 i am not qualified to form one
 mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar
 those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public
 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight
 will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began
 "i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_
 "i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself
 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot
--in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron
 "you quite mistook mr darcy
 it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them both----" "then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!" elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both
 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband
 i speak feelingly
" "dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner? he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter
 her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire
 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings
 she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
 "books--oh! no
 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is
 we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton
 there can be no occasion for your going so soon
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family
" "not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out
 there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic works
 "this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
 as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of
 our poor mother is sadly grieved
 not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive
" "my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed
 make haste, and come down this moment
 chapter xv
 for my part, mr bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently
 mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard
 with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round
 i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not
 but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art
e
 i knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them
 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in
 their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme
 ii
 my situation in life, my connections with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you
 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere
 it became her turn to listen
" "i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak what i think
" "your first position is false
 "why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time
 mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while
 as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied
 dear, dear lizzy
 it was unpardonable
" the period of expectation was now doubled
 while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came
 "it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she
 "i began to be afraid you would never come back again
--it is impossible
" "it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said bingley
 mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while
" "i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty
 "you are joking, lizzy
 darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance
 my mind was more agreeably engaged
 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes
 in society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great
"--a short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again
" elizabeth was distressed
 i believe i have now told you every thing
 she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together
 it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr darcy's steward
 what could your ladyship propose by it?" "at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted
--she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable
 she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile
 mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia
 at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library
 we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
 mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete
 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this
 who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?" elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it
" "what did you say of me, that i did not deserve? for, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof
 "but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy
 "oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable
" the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation
--"can this be mr darcy!" thought she
 with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy
b
e
 by you, i was properly humbled
" "oh! certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful
 chapter ii
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible
--he is, indeed
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master
 she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy, she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her
 his appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address
 i do not wish to avoid the walk
 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent
 "how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter
 _you_ may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer
 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable
 wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him
 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world
 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns
" jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth
 "upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion
 i quite detest the man
 mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk
 she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago
' those were your words
 mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror
 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education
 i never saw such a long chin in my life
 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her
 "you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason
 it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon
 "if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman
 mr darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet
 had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal
 "i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence
 each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them
4
" "perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often
" "i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
" then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind
 i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention; the other is charlotte's marriage
 there was also a postscript to this effect
 there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning
 mr collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels
 the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men
 see paragraph 1
 mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance
 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character
 adieu to disappointment and spleen
 "pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves
 her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_
" "would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" "upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself
" "and you saw him frequently?" "yes, almost every day
 those who chose to be idle, certainly might
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out
 the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground
 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him
" mrs hill began instantly to express her joy
 fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance
 it was agreed to
 _invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square
 good heaven! brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton
 i came to you without a doubt of my reception
 elizabeth felt jane's pleasure
" "obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that score? "let us sit down
 her colour changed, and she said no more
 who is to fight wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet came from it
 no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it
 you need not
 they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, "if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse
 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case
 pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night
 the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles
 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts
--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement
 "mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_
 _we_ were always good friends; and now we are better
 mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces
 about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate; and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement
" "but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea
 it distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage
--without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want
 no aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy
 she saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown
 it only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again
 in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation
" "your attendance upon her, has been too much for you
 i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time
 "what do you think? it is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like
 a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news
 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him
 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door
 mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking openly
 mr darcy, you cannot deny the fact
" "exceed their income! my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more
 i told mrs collins so before you came
 "oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again
" "no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself
 jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way
" "i should imagine not
 "_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas
 we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield
 it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living
 from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting
" mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter
 _you_ know him too well to doubt the rest
 kitty, run down and order the carriage
" elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more
 "i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she
 _they_ will take care not to outrun their income
 the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation
" "and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business
 he promises fairly, and i hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent
 the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again
 jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough
 i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long
 we must not all expect jane's good fortune
 neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach
 mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets
--i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to
 the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants
--but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks
 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible
 mrs reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention
 the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541
 in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger
 but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem
" "oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy
 pray go to see them, with sir william and maria
 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house
 a clergyman like you must marry
 but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself
 to mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again
" "perhaps we might be deceived
--i had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country
 wickham is safe
 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved
 i hope he will overlook it
 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
" "let her be called down
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled
" a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter
 she was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial
 it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i am strongly inclined to hope the best
 at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion
 i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure
 had he done his duty in that respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her
 "the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them
 mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation
" "i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression
 but are you pleased, jane? shall you like to have such a brother?" "very, very much
 but i am at his disposal
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible
 as they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen
 i know it to be impossible
 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward
 she has known him only a fortnight
" "but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?" "oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all
" and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room
 if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration
 since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design
 "but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well
" "neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance
" "may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "take whatever you like, and get away
 as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance
 the lucases are very artful people indeed, sister
 these recollections will not do at all
--do you play and sing, miss bennet?" "a little
 after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument
 you shall not defend her, though it is charlotte lucas
 mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else
 let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood
--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh
" he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped
 he took the hint, and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "that will do extremely well, child
 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house
 his attachment to rosings, certainly increases
 the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to mr collins! my dear charlotte,--impossible!" the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness
" "but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity

 miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before
 sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect
 he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention
 "can it be possible that he will marry her?" "wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister
 it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture
 are sufficiently known
 his character was to speak for itself
 "i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter
 but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person
 our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it some day
" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours
 his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips
 "i cannot make him out
" "that is very strange
 family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this
 nor was darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery
 with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected
 mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction
" "that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare
 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery
 i have by no means done
 for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him
 and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce
 she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked
 had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it
 i cannot think of it without abhorrence
 he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security
 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications
s
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other
 "what would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself
 vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously
 she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom
 there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others
 "oh! mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme
 mrs gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her

 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr darcy then was
 all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again
 she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained

 this letter is from mr collins
 after abusing you so abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations
 his revenge would have been complete indeed
" "mr collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known

 bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever
 the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits
" "are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?" "_i_ never saw such a woman
 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before
" "certainly," he replied, biting his lips
 she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther
" elizabeth was forced to go
 follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can
 one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, "lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe
 it is what every body says
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room

 she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess
 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation
 on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was
--but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle
 she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung

 but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce
 what a contrast between him and his friend! mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party

 her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered? from what can it proceed? it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened
 his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time
 but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name
 she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley
 again she read on
 when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject

 as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park
 perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event
 it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire
 his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured
 what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex

 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation
 she cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving wickham

 elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley
 she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him

 i knew how it would be
 that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection
 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference
 they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment
 on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance
 i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage

 my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant
 i cannot do justice to his kindness
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her
 people _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true

 had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield
--that reply will do for the present
" "good heavens!" cried elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--how could his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?" "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful
 the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game
 in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "my dear jane, make haste and hurry down
 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do
 however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham
 she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him
 "lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room
 i shall go distracted
 she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once
 and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?" "she is a most charming young lady indeed
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield
 he had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us
 that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head

 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess
 mrs wickham! how well it sounds
 the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room
 she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?" "yes, she will remain there till christmas
" "it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies
 his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do
e
 there was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected
" with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia, assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn
" "if your master would marry, you might see more of him
 mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances
" "my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to
" "and so was i
 nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained
 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience

" here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of
 "did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed
 well, how pleased i am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now
 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation
 this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day
" "it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason
 mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love
 but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early
 and her neighbours at lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time
" "miss bennet i am shocked and astonished
 it was first broken by mrs annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on
" "and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently
 "oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain
" mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible

" the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish

 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion

 "oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long
" occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend
 you will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be
 to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations
 they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister

 it was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent

 "on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago
--oh! _that_ abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it
 the room in which the ladies sat was backwards
" "in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective
 you may depend upon my seeking no further
 the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_
 "oh, lizzy! it cannot be
" "i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
" "not so hasty, if you please
" elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow
" "but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane
 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible
 the second began
 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects
 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body
" elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying
 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter
" "you did! and it was not wholly without foundation
 and when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving one also
 in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner
 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them
 here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business
 who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it
 not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room
 women fancy admiration means more than it does
 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them
 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner
" "and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added kitty
 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?" elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
 mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do
 if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement

 their reception at home was most kind
" the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn

 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you
 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation
" elizabeth made no answer
 no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time
 there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, i dare say
 younger sons cannot marry where they like

 i told my sister philips so the other day
 on mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable
--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?" "as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable
 it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say nothing of that
 i shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance i require
 as they drove to mr gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever
 bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter
 in short, i will do my best
" from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again
 this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family
 "i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard

 lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball
 "he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle
 i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman
 since her father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits
 your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i come
 i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now
 she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it
 while she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes
 she wrote even to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard
 nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece
 you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself
 it is useless to talk of it
 they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned
 the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence
 mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required
" "i am," said he, with a firm voice
 mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness
" he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend
 we _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen
 elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied

 mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both
 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way
 i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously
 after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful
" "so much the better
 after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation
 mr collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him
 they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others
 miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room
 oh, brother, how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all
 she wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her
--such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at st
 he had never before supposed that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement
 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer
 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others
 it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife
 "how can you be smiling so, lizzy?" their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago
" elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required
 while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them
 they then went away
 i do not trust my own partiality
 "don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake! have a little compassion on my nerves
" she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham

 donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations
 bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable
 "dear sir, "i must trouble you once more for congratulations
 they followed her into the dining-parlour
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power
 elizabeth now began to revive
" "oh! my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned
" "and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?" "the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting
 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds
 as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth
 after a short pause, her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me
 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street

 he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her
 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?" "i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron
 when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist

 you thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say
 elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives
 oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!" "oh! my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him

 bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed
 mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room
 on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book
 their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves
" "it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend
 "very well

 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend
--it pains me to offend you
 an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham!--imagine our surprise
 but he is a liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue
" "i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!" after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i _do_ remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities
 perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company
 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane
 here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery
 he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing
 "you have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation
 though lydia's short letter to mrs f
 take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one
" "ah!" cried mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls
" this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible
" "very true; and if i had my will, we should
 but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done
 and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away
 mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public

 a little time therefore
 "very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?" "i have, sir
 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire
 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her
 the adieu is charity itself
 she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son
 lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard, and if he does, colonel forster will hire him
 of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity
 she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by wickham
" "it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill
 elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it
 perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now
 mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her
 the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life
 as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer
" "_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza," said charlotte
 she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body
" "you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers
 to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed
 his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret
 at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain
 1
 one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad

 my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr darcy
 she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin
 though her manner varied however, her determination never did

 "you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour
 but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise
" "but you--how are you?" cried elizabeth
" mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise

" this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley
 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
 jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved
 we acted with the best intentions
 every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight
 jane now came up
 i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it
 mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began
 to all the objections i have already urged, i have still another to add
 copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change
 nothing could console and nothing appease her
 after this day, jane said no more of her indifference
 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival
 the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room
 it was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up
 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
 when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal
 if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball
 elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her
 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard
 it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself
 lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts
 "you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine
 she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains
' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?" "yes, ma'am, all
 she is quite a little creature
--"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this
 her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her
 he danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner
 "you forget that i have made no answer
 as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out
 bingley is most unaffectedly modest
 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy
 elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter
" as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind
 "he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can
 wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly sisters
 elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes
 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion
