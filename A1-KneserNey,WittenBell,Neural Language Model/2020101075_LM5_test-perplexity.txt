mr bennet protested against any description of finery 6.811112456056425

and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses 26.74528416908828 
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word 36.52047083534155 
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided 25.0640970872143

the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter 10.722132317010923 
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched 48.099678778004474

nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 7.614918750299171 
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married 48.28777563208735 
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her 19.249245918741618 
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister 70.22052657389428 
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 29.300158871398615

" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance 14.307625997261376 
of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 23.34299481154076 
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing 28.434606158766332

when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 64.93639133258272 
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge 23.639749471754385

poor dear child and now here ' s mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do 74.82402872387553 
" " upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 22.267282688541762 
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence 23.940015241094976 
" not yet , " replied jane 6.005891392887991 
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself 25.40174416485809 
thank heaven he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves 14.048831050724358 
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself 28.20887683634718 
mr bennet could not have chosen better 6.1279920292542505 
" " go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks 19.92464392914373 
she could think only of her letter 6.1128725182844255 
thank god i have not _that_ pain 6.0535775575491195 
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 6.913387578742174 
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings 43.14985012727575 
" " removed " cried bingley 4.918398250401065 
" " yes , sir , i know i am 9.01502047194887 
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me 45.92452668838525 
" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 43.694078627378985 
" " mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again 25.679012797538345 
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her 11.256281140828126 
we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 39.400291061348824 
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life 38.51992723285902 
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 34.1374079485845 
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage 24.26682769777602 
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month 23.436646930664452 
" " did charlotte dine with you ? " " no , she would go home 15.402510424159821 
they were not the only objects of mr collins ' s admiration 11.136838715741405 
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton 84.98725983114707 
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone 37.916651763010364 
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs forster , the delight of mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described 30.728954596402183 
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side 25.112991008275927 
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy 51.64661414175434 
you must and shall be married by a special licence 8.626561971406204 
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep 20.82296662199609 
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much 29.64442991068095 
this information , however , startled mrs bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so 45.57201303125612 
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends 22.101514173017275 
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you 13.037023821448857 
well i am so happy 4.012710562401879 
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s 14.06720895521409 
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 28.63066204763015 
" " i am afraid you do not like your pen 10.641740774923514 
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor 17.19298320844054 
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do 8.907423768439731 
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever 7.892348340139681 
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library 40.39485853617676 
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book 23.15635225618354 
" her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital 10.130593225989795 
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day 33.079989011315504 
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 24.956087137842633 
his plan did not vary on seeing them 7.124681643567393 
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless 29.540914498207428 
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there 37.2131594108844 
" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation 39.42848895432543 
not these two or three years perhaps 6.210631437487871 
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity 59.725824184696336 
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it 40.726812008896616 
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up 33.94277318580345 
" " no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did 15.619780960282373 
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground 10.645297581446702 
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph 9.87274536860015 
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 44.89112774956346 
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct 21.448992339509164 
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it 22.366481088412872 
" " very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 48.84772963349814 
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage 15.731524824313313 
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet 42.04530421115681 
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned 8.02056239917259 
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative 35.582545188498955 
" " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart 55.56062027243581 
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet 23.387399982271145 
" " oh my dear brother , " replied mrs bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for 21.080100686304604 
lydia , my love , ring the bell 7.070012138361049 
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee 26.231420124718458 
" " aye that is because you have the right disposition 10.568790648667187 
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn 12.990503478669883 
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her 7.998711678541784 
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party 12.266177285679934 
but you know married women have never much time for writing 10.120998927557164 
" " you are then resolved to have him ? " " i have said no such thing 17.585320784427626 
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village 16.31954323118995 
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could 48.724437187998326 
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment 24.4326946118278 
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice 37.94129514897582 
" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr hurst 9.694280145428587 
her power was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 22.8066829786054 
colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings 30.1030835812052 
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk 36.34952997914672 
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought 12.109453928186442 
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 8.995757130807759 
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before 13.06397977047502 
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 10.954944537455559 
but she would not be secure 4.991431887673993 
lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster 7.974053167586761 
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline 14.137556615988796 
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for 17.045458565694297 
mr collins made his declaration in form 5.768783236181916 
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 9.10940809998833 
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so 10.107784549737868 
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 6.032672207615485 
" " all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 33.095840825327656 
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia 19.604746237928527 
" john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? " " yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 34.704141400616365 
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 33.663451852500906 
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st 67.1025291652378 
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she 12.012429206148507 
" " it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are 28.039570165741335 
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other 16.403219603345775 
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 23.49361353043126 
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out 64.059556874414 
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise 37.24971150562902 
" " aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to 32.643868956088525 
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious 63.22186485888678 
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 68.48704273223497 
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 18.71609329632974 
" jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante 46.81923906089887 
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 12.520749631982715 
" ' tis an etiquette i despise , " said he 9.732886665715222 
this is my advice 2.8732086616617005 
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley 11.994375269439507 
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment 44.09173842180387 
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 , " information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation 34.37911526867578 
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them " " your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you 43.444281100923924 
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps 86.66857967256534 
" " certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 22.784838452808835 
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 97.33822519245922 
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family 23.101920875695484 
" " she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley 11.828745385133061 
" " has your governess left you ? " " we never had any governess 14.215943650057447 
" " is he married or single ? " " oh single , my dear , to be sure a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year 31.663352589000603 
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home 55.123931353243435 
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body 24.112742640583498 
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 32.66884292425696 
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no , no i feel he may defy us there 16.954426193487787 
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man i will think no more about him 59.78756030233242 
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure 13.051234740783725 
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room 58.29223483578557 
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty 11.609743793616639 
" " if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards 53.96468037109019 
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 76.40772682653963 
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here 17.108924112477208 
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came 20.545521234051627 
but what does he say of the living ? " " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only 41.84982990322402 
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless 20.32882774391575 
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable 36.784029833320716 
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt 53.705494109672344 
" i admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he 12.959544062819694 
i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable 56.71302072249091 
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 24.826368655953395 
" " pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state 52.75297023282941 
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear 30.880496308730894 
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me 25.29671690503473 
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless 13.842621451835381 
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her 22.401428873371824 
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs 19.38824584347986 
will you hear it ? " " most willingly 8.181194701792645 
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her 49.38843398717563 
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 8.97533864752704 
' she did indeed 2.981670290346748 
" " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other 22.910580044550972 
i am excessively attentive to all those things 6.895886655155894 
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford 8.537170169737045 
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense 46.505580802936116 
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it 16.25819774952578 
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before 71.75314718469032 
" " _that_ is a failing indeed " cried elizabeth 8.535689026341732 
" this was invitation enough 4.177933013761736 
" her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented 38.254333777416264 
you will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you 21.01493270094368 
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means 10.923088901346828 
" there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming 30.559847328141664 
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration 54.573863591369204 
" " but not before they went to brighton ? " " no , i believe not 15.634686759367463 
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night 18.572114243038083 
" " and do you like her ? " " very much 11.138631307401335 
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received 26.000069431085688 
" " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of 15.110089829398987 
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner 63.570451425016174 
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized 30.45420329618518 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 9.066672985019824 
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find 19.03049363615282 
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled 28.323211511118185 
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make _their_ marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 83.64779974400805 
" she replied in the affirmative 4.85763242349866 
the officer was the very mr denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed 22.986260917483726 
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet 19.40232817768625 
end of the second volume 4.049534528017965 
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 68.84431319319721 
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not 13.961289945930464 
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 14.10322374588419 
" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable 57.40545924798414 
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost 7.915748743024881 
" " this account then is what he has received from mr darcy 12.408852883367778 
" " this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced 11.139835816440048 
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : " i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil 64.90513007103134 
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 55.07028855361298 
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring 9.930845485723287 
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper 18.51988459139284 
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former 59.33089788770554 
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much 28.236907362894122 
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ 8.90208015425307 
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief 16.00337464335678 
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 13.168277302875932 
i am very glad you liked her 6.279735967799552 
he was very fond of them 5.070000123854658 
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , ' mr collins , you must marry 56.41714115874722 
you alluded to something else 3.9600543655874367 
many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man 48.32054092993783 
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 25.11050916233965 
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton 34.37696423414948 
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them 35.77583892137152 
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word 12.997927836154936 
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied 11.148233990714328 
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s 46.00193635336123 
" " pray tell your sister that i long to see her 11.170060243886608 
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 8.717808510015836 
" a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure 12.013115337913517 
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him 31.61172662708611 
" yes , she called yesterday with her father 7.6679712513265175 
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy 39.95905588366118 
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 32.58482189834699 
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn 7.741154460951449 
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres 20.881491506841154 
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 12.203949572481275 
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands 34.57093328908603 
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr darcy walk into the room 29.558113108026337 
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it 16.589892595525185 
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair 38.86768674168653 
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence 55.51851238181039 
" of music then pray speak aloud 5.964820526113941 
" " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? " " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property 35.53116979766993 
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? i cannot quite agree with you _there_ 27.311037707837496 
after a short silence , the lady first spoke 8.21046327769445 
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel 68.83776010559791 
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her 35.81367526097945 
" miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 20.95817798709988 
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered 29.120158474781316 
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 50.57356298063577 
" " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 33.47733749313796 
" wickham only shook his head 5.148997706990884 
" " insolent girl " said elizabeth to herself 8.016033731867825 
_that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter 24.297672949322813 
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year 15.47190233003738 
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself 22.6729662270953 
" " yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing 10.136635246425945 
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows 64.7842155309073 
she was overpowered by shame and vexation 5.789243085364082 
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 13.807973505242883 
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens 15.348782049619746 
their table was superlatively stupid 4.062994811151196 
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham 54.276180893361555 
sir william did not say much 4.917671965485316 
mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house 21.962780318975614 
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected 22.765994322742397 
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together 48.48728752558867 
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter 43.14219278752268 
" " i am talking of possibilities , charles 8.253826839510223 
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into 37.20553643395885 
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used 49.59944106421754 
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour 15.184626162731679 
he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women 10.401032570510141 
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed 9.98915443244168 
" " how strange " cried elizabeth 5.948299973366052 
at present i will say nothing about it 7.200385776907231 
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 36.56787970956848 
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 18.971963154795304 
mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family 17.164421945050464 
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent 9.929681667062894 
" " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two 17.35275678461912 
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ? oh here comes hill 15.41400797203859 
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us 16.946251930956777 
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to 42.440049771084354 
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 12.783975664293353 
no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection 11.790920759496535 
" does that young lady know mr darcy ? " elizabeth coloured , and said " a little 16.672166122400448 
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two 13.931434399769197

lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 46.84788685649936 
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met 19.448951403447527 
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness 8.083361863821425 
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy 18.09931040121977 
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state 8.212881872235872 
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us 13.30573239641107 
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 7.087736349729992 
" " it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 26.984193105172373 
he had been some time with mr gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning 46.40687608611985 
" she is so fond of mrs forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much 38.90205584367207 
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 68.679296551098 
they were , therefore , to go 6.05450351634376 
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites 70.37309232876962 
in the evening , soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 30.394405736843456 
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion 28.006234013821246 
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence 12.613721627144983 
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him 27.58660314976843 
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was 45.35241232108116 
london : printed for t 3.9122213862291892 
he is his own master 3.8460717047370436 
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding 34.93175218583419 
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me 17.905455211614296 
nobody wants him to come 3.9999944465611037 
everything wore a happier aspect 3.985166297636813 
" " yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly 12.054527240487106 
" thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room 51.41128569738306 
but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me 38.50104151581824 
i guessed as much 2.9090544653453763 
i expected you to stay two months 6.038779032525596 
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 13.19129751986112 
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels 16.355654187479843 
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance 45.63412163918738 
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed 36.12956467754778 
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family 31.297589230596497 
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably 9.976735440152568 
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else 10.864273661146242 
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " there can be no doubt of that 40.818995171918594 
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal 11.815997792219783 
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters 57.35496770963956 
" my dear , dear lydia " she cried : " this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good , kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing 47.54411763609929 
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent 40.20889721567871 
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word 8.983124079455976 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 26.830507075660975 
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 13.343747257850385 
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply 12.390159553143375 
" elizabeth could not but look surprised 5.926366261570356 
" " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball 24.102563255874415 
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 21.19996435530341 
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well 42.791967889113266 
" " i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age 15.152858254031267 
" i do not get on at all 7.128881008566493 
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 65.05210009408884 
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject 21.10626692187882 
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man 89.80836350232312 
i am the happiest creature in the world 6.8913754898416 
" " all what , all five out at once ? very odd and you only the second 16.967639750980318 
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment 22.100016695644428 
i hope they will not meet at all 7.006668386370395 
" and gravely glancing at mr darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with ' keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song 43.431146721179694 
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me 12.42308951536314 
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned 65.15334886784161 
" he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 16.17325425443395 
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure 62.41973258608438 
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 33.30511481156182 
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 28.74435844033503 
they were natural and just 3.8591317777595764 
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time 31.212306387468395 
" " lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent 15.170949491699123 
" the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair 64.84578119164246 
" good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 22.760560978634945 
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 48.412165477613456 
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible 63.74703988791616 
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents 18.247839925238992 
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both 49.42050048060277 
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 4.942160226764801 
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly 5.081996932935889 
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility 27.002067441677497 
however , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than " plain vanilla ascii " or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <URL> you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of exporting a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original " plain vanilla ascii " or other form 93.10611285232545 
the discussion of mr collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother 37.32273220699346 
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic 11.202440523150306 
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment 22.594255220329224 
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you " " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved 69.21712725528673 
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 4.970939328871308 
" " you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence 17.34801110452858 
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum 59.754561874733646 
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country 50.917599424531325 
but here he was set right by mrs bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 37.96580922701201 
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance 7.005511642681245 
let me do it without farther loss of time 8.201913540621254 
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it 28.428030836741122 
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill 11.323315461653223 
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters 14.352654433531319 
" " your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you 14.304025851079777 
i send no compliments to your mother 5.980442748385082 
" then turning to mr bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon 14.45124058393864 
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point 15.040743298331382 
it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors 40.44106852077847 
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you 23.890612871730752 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way 29.376703440748116 
" " what do you mean ? " " why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley 23.528637866518533 
" " certainly not 3.0053367558939184 
what i have to say relates to poor lydia 8.004737817711721 
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 112.56814390935978 
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves 20.670846108763552 
" " the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt 20.97110928984488 
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better 45.49116720163145 
in understanding darcy was the superior 5.083863128926009 
" " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure 15.84855025877669 
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 55.63361033255664 
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 15.288243610745322 
let me hear from you very soon 6.119559984753209 
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 10.040384429993923 
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _should_ be looked at 16.231541783272952 
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 42.560463859432 
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing 17.574040914751308 
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other 9.964660831604201 
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham 29.336692989428563 
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err 40.68610958085375 
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her 115.80597124932022 
" " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson ; did not i mention it to you ? mr robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point 82.94300594585366 
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr bingley might like you the best of the party 42.23183300701092 
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 21.256939905908993 
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go 8.0420908766805 
" " i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 27.388731550940378 
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said mr gardiner 14.235179829040064 
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it 28.007832310600573 
" chapter vi 2.013939135823144 
widely different was the effect of a second perusal 7.9926573860365036 
it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq 11.232769704618027 
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing 15.961589394718633 
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself 18.749891948374106 
" i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town 18.532151306883808 
" they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr bingley and his sisters 30.98524681248102 
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided 16.29617574220941 
" " with the officers " cried lydia 6.9396411165280725 
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 9.21324911126511 
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was 39.64135005472003 
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 11.089411665117806 
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park 13.021910696056429 
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 51.54300570315455 
" she looks sickly and cross 4.963817400138103 
" if he wants our society , let him seek it 9.705223663987399 
his brother in law , mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year 59.39782214392817 
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 46.15688410345838 
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother 34.66945428178422 
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy but do not be cast down 20.258305340926235 
first of all , he asked miss lucas 6.973990035676999 
" " i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 37.36845462920972 
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 11.71500595855937 
i know no harm of her 5.045438162993589 
elizabeth went away with her head full of him 8.164531377665666 
" " and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully 41.00441137517603 
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 55.93105560142664 
" " his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it 27.75676570714674 
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them 23.782684765380605 
but mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it 10.073715953368968 
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks 31.483998075217453 
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work 45.32249492656072 
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling 10.184477785371895 
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable 67.66760708402776 
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet 45.1231004507225 
you know i have 2.939569501812648 
on their being joined by mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 56.34630179955567 
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell " elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal 34.17432625887042 
there could not exist in the world _two_ men , over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence 18.412602927446038 
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight 16.255182460165376 
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly 15.019374682831703 
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 41.679632961274955 
he seldom appeared really animated 3.968656718370158 
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire 18.274161816603826 
" " an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty miles 14.047969274879495 
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places 21.831265295756346 
what could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room 29.979363397463477 
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 9.989237586560835 
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 25.235018811633523 
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 79.90162764763603 
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 28.01573178759668

they were hopeless of remedy 3.923694870719399

such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them 31.739240800546714 
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own 61.84124776504414 
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " oh " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted 33.97024782167529 
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place 43.068392461725345 
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr collins ' s scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that mr wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house 89.02828399377015 
but let me advise you to think better of it 8.972759388712563 
i hope she will turn out well 6.112679180868439 
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt 41.02041880611023 
" mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 31.92558840112779 
but it is of small importance 4.9873120554974335 
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ 12.950511836037235 
we were married , you know , at st 8.196964366319039 
mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other 20.06427506198501 
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness 55.571122424458004 
" " probably not ; but mr darcy can please where he chuses 12.133805127459532 
i enquired after their brother , of course 6.9654535574718714 
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there 53.124353374570994 
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did 24.2324279245234

he placed himself by her 3.9832324791276434 
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character 28.67362579243706 
there can be no love in all this 6.900379794460725 
" mr and mrs gardiner smiled 5.044412859165325 
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them 11.953196412306747 
" she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 33.64208164489061 
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth 10.294355355296176 
" _you_ were mr bingley ' s first choice 7.570068536294482 
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little 84.16155964418478 
my dear jane , mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking 52.62373163843634

" mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it 16.098644163435814 
you never see a fault in any body 6.846640709813042 
it is of all subjects my delight 5.748931823992579 
she liked him too little to care for his approbation 8.886650922695647 
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more 24.94831171576341 
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie 35.13853353471864 
we had better not mention it 5.112747297975175 
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name 20.827803878676157 
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers 64.25423094753774 
" she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 25.762657978852083 
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister 11.896987501131761 
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house 21.53514217958598 
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted 23.96456596851118 
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family 53.79624209426766 
those who do not complain are never pitied 7.016221827362904 
i know we dine with four and twenty families 7.896964427887164 
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on 57.25742468415743 
" " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s 11.026765880086247 
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 16.470828555908955 
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 22.76141327963007 
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over 53.259851662371304 
its completion depended on others 3.988949894730595 
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses 58.331070575347226 
" " certainly 1.991956941369747 
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 33.77341830575422 
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 40.57314043598536 
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance 39.46356073093827 
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness 38.33530870694225 
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities 20.00179197184295 
their powers of conversation were considerable 5.1466001381771385 
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high 34.34842475655264 
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success 36.80905625816671 
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters 39.698179672011335 
her reflections were in general satisfactory 4.872685721886531 
you may have drawn him in 5.143190891436095 
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ? " said jane as she finished it 57.246399856676675 
" " _you_ observed it , mr darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley ; " and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition 37.85766738783949 
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough 12.780991249137013 
the first week of their return was soon gone 8.089749923791771 
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished 15.229012224050596 
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on 36.13891189582576 
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day 53.44071131841915 
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 128.8808126013217 
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 13.739368768257249 
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs gardiner 11.066880434567938 
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us 12.172573541644848 
" " you may depend upon my not mentioning it 8.779046257257793 
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 15.78476063853748 
" " _mr darcy_ , you see , is the man now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprised you 20.477226217295815 
that is the place to get husbands 5.956065517569342 
" " no , indeed , i did not 7.925175838374363 
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 88.28409954591918 
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon 23.875656840790654 
" " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it 27.774040706619562 
" " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened " " perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister 38.3546018781108 
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it 6.966412331018563 
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 7.257044656611942 
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 9.919864671233022 
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day 59.291274754346254 
why jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley 26.450198090405102 
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks 31.487302656692233 
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states 18.265042766515165 
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year 69.29393391685132 
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer 42.8689622521837 
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage 17.888943202888836 
elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together 11.926100310677171 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 15.027676430540803

if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity 38.137091283502386 
' allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer 39.772616650147825 
" " it was a subject which they could not mention before me 12.082399588175843 
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart 22.51500263136412 
lord how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 22.75996973796741 
" " indeed , mr collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary 13.271572279074816 
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it 22.55005218473347 
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 9.635930315940707 
" he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling 35.58414183968457 
" the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit 24.45017800190065 
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ? " " i think she will 30.561947091317613 
" " undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation 30.9833424392581 
he replied , and was again silent 6.460982982906154 
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 65.25822733921719 
nor did that day wear out her resentment 6.864105096125049 
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure 12.857083628468645 
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 28.71480143668114 
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection 19.725483489115334 
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 56.60575002045208 
do not you , darcy ? " " my style of writing is very different from yours 16.24634187987666 
poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion 39.18527323886975 
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention 30.088833656413676 
she is almost three and twenty lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think 35.43040539059913 
" " she will drop the acquaintance entirely 7.241401180413686 
i did not know before , that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony 15.44346390292073 
" every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away 18.668923066707812 
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances 13.784230095089104 
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn 34.712911105166384 
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham 39.14784719158157 
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long 13.293245640854302 
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend 9.809760038029827 
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame 15.706233677931072 
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance 28.401844453692984 
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him 17.864507871314704 
from his garden , mr collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help 69.56054168779299

" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all 19.241892550821643 
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 33.90687652315012 
but mrs bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before 36.0829995426529 
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion " " oh jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " i do not know 51.87377678720441

" " yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever 13.962756390951094 
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule 19.809144517937337 
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson ' s room 59.54852514847113 
" " well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose 13.308550547386398 
" " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 40.02399839031385 
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice 24.325311330840872

" elizabeth almost stared at her 5.035278805342509 
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself 29.652843841423454 
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth 7.753526776363043 
" " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " " dearest jane who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means 40.62406797942014 
mrs bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense " " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he 23.012587442965092 
" " i have no right to give _my_ opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise 22.15998255965515

they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight 23.153500002188895 
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable 25.614450185735578 
how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 64.16853909041447 
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 17.457637885217274 
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses 73.09449440188266 
" " and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ' s journey 19.21690169153954 
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing 33.82849047566575 
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 24.210465628493527 
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit 18.37551183953663 
" it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey 48.95453792356223 
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence 42.42034115201157 
when first mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son 24.82090586623703 
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _she_ a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit 74.96437534947431 
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming 19.112026785457957 
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon 12.021939483602694 
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast 6.255010484481042 
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted 34.944213987563735 
why should they try to influence him ? they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it 27.938441735897875 
my father bears it better 3.908959070784593 
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her 51.8389043781733 
" " to yield readily easily to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you 16.095155984840478 
" " and they _must_ marry yet he is _such_ a man " " yes , yes , they must marry 20.188055433136316 
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility 27.646785915054668 
" mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward 49.70435785466147 
" mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well 34.471919581017715 
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade 34.10739868616199

he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard 16.084760937698462 
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living 17.502344686144887 
" " you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan 18.13145604337233 
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny 25.874783956269212 
by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt " " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy 66.54543035486988 
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 37.21819854385593 
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare 28.227163402438787 
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr darcy 47.53119495955969 
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 39.070849235142674 
" " no governess how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing 24.167141002972524 
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars 24.039691775165156 
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself 26.281950662324476 
do not distress me by the idea 6.0324489585541015 
" " yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside 13.229908628537935 
" " really , mr collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly 17.91009958264131 
" she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 25.156427516446584 
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas 43.72288826619769 
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say 21.77483769400425 
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject 15.285036764047355 
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing 12.874101912656641 
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 35.33786731447598 
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation i _will_ leave him to himself 38.03756511493962

society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body 25.140233176201722 
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 18.22182940341953 
i beg you will not go 5.103254930365019 
" " no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose 11.985236787676389 
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 58.15244437012903 
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display 60.80351855381493 
" " my dear mr bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 21.070301475401017 
it was then disclosed in the following manner 6.858594115133225 
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is 11.879887131870824 
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner 8.216287237587155 
i could hardly keep my countenance 5.117616777281356 
the rector of a parish has much to do 8.033517208657594 
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected 21.508623141627364 
" but so we all do 4.861671456808327 
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition 28.03538416097025 
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 54.77801809256251 
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 27.209443026192126 
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection 15.183595315845235 
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he _did_ i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson 29.992799172545453 
" " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her 11.1398641560121 
i am sure you will be very comfortable there 7.897969364804976 
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome 54.77284671178999 
you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you 15.740621109902778 
his father , miss bennet , the late mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections 49.61240804659746 
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 13.322839397383037 
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 32.40183150270525 
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you 45.3275573821936 
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire 26.435875826769735 
mr darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding 9.17732017935007 
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are 45.70501832714796 
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party 8.601176134822651 
he owns it himself without disguise 4.998306229178416 
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency 19.495572613492687 
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on 30.26612718455907 
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham ' s attentions 44.06483818212989 
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step 32.410302117442555 
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment 21.26886219908206 
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance 36.58748146170599 
it was gratitude 1.9945174976724713 
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him 13.01503465414965 
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl 27.60819053209067 
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult 10.875523778376845 
" " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course 25.044837396498814 
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful 28.751625746331435 
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves 24.40135810057316 
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient 11.961750206797992 
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p 26.243320894326395 
" " with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it 16.011335066475176 
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information 28.618542064424943 
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either 13.479221470364738 
elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it 13.793095804821196 
" and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together 13.089718416991003 
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud 12.34780979440604 
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled 14.130864312247772 
" and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident 32.07810633887301 
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 35.534440178660425 
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 68.89868671191495 
at length the parsonage was discernible 4.965904190751071 
" " i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ? but i have other provocations 65.36595790451614 
" " is it possible " cried elizabeth , when she had finished 11.774846891261644 
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business 42.631906190271486

her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her 47.00154461991384 
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success 19.14543727458862 
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 148.98055141621543

" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it 34.34914555692251 
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 42.461094372907446 
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least 27.3608229341332 
it must be an amusing study 4.901520266346821 
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself 23.773226417564157 
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together 13.730449647298547 
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 13.301213093208599 
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me 42.22246708160142 
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage 12.166433810464536

he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley 27.527376497741688 
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour 23.030452532507724 
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly 33.218302605358105 
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all 41.403100395606515 
" well , lizzy , " said mrs bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ' s ? for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 41.37143946792723

mrs philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar 58.44878664666684 
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public 123.70950615907631

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot 64.38810674289202 
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 24.29587193075279 
" you quite mistook mr darcy 5.012124890489539 
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane ; " they are married " elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both 43.30046045881466 
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 8.250074810925222 
i speak feelingly 1.9886970929302812 
" " dear madam , " cried mrs hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner ? he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter 43.70250919646549 
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire 34.49818088672492 
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings 33.585933838650554 
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 38.64127260741804 
" books oh no 3.069885607771361 
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is 12.683319221163357 
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton 12.905394300577543 
there can be no occasion for your going so soon 9.10233002294373 
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 14.28243438702289 
" " not that i _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out 49.579238944682366 
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works 33.26053180298345 
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 27.4934509932331 
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of 43.04360901389776 
our poor mother is sadly grieved 5.065758091633911 
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive 26.655722421878796 
" " my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed 10.085342219043811 
make haste , and come down this moment 7.043933578612021 
for my part , mr bingley , _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently 23.330101666556093 
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 71.58131649893552 
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round 14.112698803520683 
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not 19.33575868954136 
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art 15.159614387636944 
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them 38.4050837904279 
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her 66.11863319534396 
" " when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 35.31352592192456 
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in 10.815479181342655 
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme 20.98066013655997 
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you 59.811782795481925 
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere 9.564052924681407 
it became her turn to listen 5.014910082824421 
" " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think 20.227666654903274 
" " your first position is false 5.80411547200181 
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 86.79183644205199 
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 24.145758405136593 
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone 30.402207818287952 
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while 11.879924480698001 
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied 60.153220805857394 
dear , dear lizzy 2.9469402918790673 
it was unpardonable 2.0522864963924428 
" the period of expectation was now doubled 7.221595490689015 
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came 57.05655938496916 
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she 14.827033030918786 
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again 11.019806158076463 
it is impossible 1.9107233948533766 
" " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley 16.4413438953287 
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him 46.973487609611254 
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 9.156039187106767 
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while 43.80923930606705 
" " i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 51.77877784855149 
" you are joking , lizzy 5.147466758922049 
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing 25.91390892013823 
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance 43.903078789786285 
my mind was more agreeably engaged 5.477208165190081 
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes 40.85406079378509 
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great 14.317113497893144 
" a short pause followed this speech , and mrs hurst began again 12.35233143669387 
" elizabeth was distressed 3.044699202581626 
i believe i have now told you every thing 8.213256030297671 
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together 71.43861233397033 
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it 22.221618671788733 
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr darcy ' s steward 86.50342436989668 
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 19.95879121976528 
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 22.353249547059704 
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile 85.93632232648531 
mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia 22.173426761386185 
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library 91.73417509795837 
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money 13.573285781318274 
mr collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 11.049364180860493 
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this 41.883449549898366 
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it 98.94198415772097 
" " what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof 41.555176783429154 
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " a thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy 48.792916807797994 
" oh , yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable 15.026092727918535 
" the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation 12.211207974227536 
" can this be mr darcy " thought she 8.095343091617119 
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy 147.1773425476897 
by you , i was properly humbled 6.41614118266223 
" " oh certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions 20.226290860416654 
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful 20.672648186190894 
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 8.933998587417 
he is , indeed 2.9354520030220406 
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master 39.11484328616442 
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her 54.11394734060518 
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address 27.799260245303458 
i do not wish to avoid the walk 7.135477403536291 
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 41.3550415649772 
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr darcy , " she cried ; " i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 34.046276945687936 
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 42.08682550690703 
_you_ may ask questions , which _i_ shall not choose to answer 11.01080338295253 
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable 31.092172423623158 
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him 24.3090120073456 
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world 33.763732678955876 
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 20.105266411180605 
" jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth 13.99565687639672 
" upon my word , " said mrs gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion 20.420195078473427 
i quite detest the man 3.956323560982346 
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk 19.23599631027587 
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 19.00100395849397 
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago 14.762809146138327 
' those were your words 3.988307969675317 
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror 18.256951375508635 
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 10.034011807218507 
i never saw such a long chin in my life 8.571136562443414 
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 13.458015716383565 
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason 17.05929849002918 
it was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon 22.55364909739114 
" if i , " said mr collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 56.840850014188774 
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet 10.02223738088455 
had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal 38.52099300782521 
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 61.818317056052166 
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them 47.40515942749188 
" " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often 16.842178721326988 
" " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 15.089613089091568 
" then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind 41.53655037722971 
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte ' s marriage 20.916559277447647 
there was also a postscript to this effect 6.770760319216478 
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning 24.724637534854246 
mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels 41.33640959510329 
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men 51.630644993339054 
see paragraph 1 2.012948227396668 
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 52.97117158223107 
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character 18.214834698109794 
adieu to disappointment and spleen 4.107589436836165 
" pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves 40.99648626676854 
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ 50.64253604233657 
" " would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself 39.66319478425945 
" " and you saw him frequently ? " " yes , almost every day 14.611284618903252 
those who chose to be idle , certainly might 8.142471963646447 
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 25.885718979974353 
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 21.07118127401822 
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 52.43438062516456 
" mrs hill began instantly to express her joy 8.102054500816868 
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance 43.57819792124964 
it was agreed to 3.129463623029337 
_invented by m rs bell 26 charlotte street bedford square 8.962996783793479 
good heaven brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton 31.44548672183802 
i came to you without a doubt of my reception 8.999090713732949 
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure 4.852028969655605 
" " obstinate , headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? " let us sit down 36.2036347326075 
her colour changed , and she said no more 8.187877578158623 
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr bennet came from it 51.27590079463592 
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it 19.834087009310924 
you need not 1.973874567123095 
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma ' am , he is walking towards the little copse 67.1602750264062 
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 23.00586357730004 
consider how important every moment is , in such a case 9.76144695009835 
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night 17.93313689560326 
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles 13.160752613145348 
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 10.04391153946752 
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts 31.65557758662693 
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement 25.155648407334873 
" mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza to be only just _tolerable_ 23.07522535345294 
_we_ were always good friends ; and now we are better 10.131951152203431 
mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces 32.19806789371711 
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement 117.83614142692575 
" " but that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea 27.308297333695844 
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 22.131100870774773 
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want 45.66471225851486 
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy 22.59251019845634 
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown 17.008967803181832 
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling 10.849410260070776 
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again 21.82691174420544 
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 33.97519902296541 
" " your attendance upon her , has been too much for you 12.08742812221354 
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time 35.99430850074347 
" what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like 22.894468880985553 
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence 13.963537246499518 
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news 17.617265323559373 
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him 47.86035449263182 
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door 45.04952039119766 
mrs gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly 69.64201311463636 
mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact 6.960558503380667 
" " exceed their income my dear mr bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more 36.425592910461916 
i told mrs collins so before you came 6.838254824644533 
" oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again 26.98513336876978 
" " no , i thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself 15.09392995692974 
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way 18.200936056630784 
" " i should imagine not 5.10888546412963 
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas 19.304656868753263 
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her 46.55191290866334 
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield 23.931924865639633 
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living 29.92628165689903 
from the entrance hall , of which mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs jenkinson were sitting 47.151817025478195 
" mr collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 24.15563486049134 
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest 7.864143333916915 
kitty , run down and order the carriage 7.06296658668638 
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more 12.060229356838272 
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she 14.1839357213582 
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income 8.20839378052296 
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 26.096510721851132 
" " and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems an hopeless business 15.929867469040158 
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent 25.88673097180163 
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 43.2070588215118 
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham 49.11920748324714 
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough 57.41732990225859 
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long 19.925354577517783 
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune 8.969154486570181 
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach 34.687909344099424 
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets 6.082241623469255 
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to 31.56515911564521 
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants 50.99632631259018 
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks 18.229270533184554 
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? mr bingley will not be detained in london by them 55.86757103461463 
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible 17.080336275867836 
mrs reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time 15.65797317840403 
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention 24.157060689925647 
the foundation ' s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541 12.170039211065788 
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger 62.686436846249 
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 18.29684156866854 
" " oh no it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy 14.918508470633768 
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria 10.298634655215468 
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 31.879890339336374 
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house 28.01273339713819 
a clergyman like you must marry 5.068673449797539 
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 15.239298216000527 
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself 20.67502316368621 
to mr bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 38.34169223588191 
" " perhaps we might be deceived 5.918479511126866 
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country 31.408377569252224 
wickham is safe 1.9174859166096505 
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 8.032598701567082 
i hope he will overlook it 4.97949252532662 
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners 34.352157556317046 
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 67.3817856224217 
" " let her be called down 6.125282176472647 
" you are a good girl ; " he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 23.810162688582036 
" a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter 43.623903778373936 
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 53.57224790009457 
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 50.03978768457088 
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion 23.589200272332526 
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen 14.402227578383878 
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 24.93666737506034 
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 29.958238731737303 
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them 25.691534289137046 
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of 12.331211044243151 
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation 69.92089050524011 
" " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 15.18404662114603 
but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? " " very , very much 21.012044907103828 
but i am at his disposal 4.988811899022238 
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? impossible 56.61816911942159 
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen 23.30859239707672 
i know it to be impossible 5.009702246974186 
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 11.547436947401797 
she has known him only a fortnight 6.014064122615208 
" " but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " " oh , yes that , that is the worst of all 37.102685332633115 
" and with a bow to mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room 27.16399061089601 
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least 29.37114131573478 
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration 62.19373559841817 
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _his_ design 38.50985012337057 
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well 15.842242943651463 
" " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance 25.948078995943145 
" " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " take whatever you like , and get away 24.48394577355918 
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance 31.784504447031402 
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister 8.581376598528825 
these recollections will not do at all 5.780855286592056 
do you play and sing , miss bennet ? " " a little 12.134834634629435 
after tea , mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument 22.194053047075315 
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas 9.991978331699734 
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else 55.90530977143658 
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood 16.95954062488734 
every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh 65.33377575259422 
" he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped 11.897381157224903 
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child 24.412230915670985 
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house 9.96651578860472 
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases 6.08601699514575 
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte , impossible " the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 219.50028505775998 
" " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity 17.21850935762319 
fairbanks , ak , 99712 3.9665834204439037 
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 20.31957382965282 
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers 24.54496219585327 
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 24.867279399365607 
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention 18.73050038876438 
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister 30.25326658241115 
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture 10.318686517854578 
are sufficiently known 1.9175056230657552 
his character was to speak for itself 5.946240715020437 
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter 21.90708140525638 
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person 22.879697581357647 
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to you shall try it some day 14.77542760502614 
" " she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours 38.48157353238741 
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips 12.118538394239595 
" i cannot make him out 5.048989905850309 
" " that is very strange 5.199690527610733 
family pride , and _filial_ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this 20.057156965047213 
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery 19.033630651829224 
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected 9.996717413202054 
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction 27.230531678928337 
" " that is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare 19.36487407650875 
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 6.15481591864643 
i have by no means done 4.988468888879425 
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him 10.84836335729284 
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce 76.43494083525334 
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked 23.43293531438254 
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it 62.20785076198762 
i cannot think of it without abhorrence 5.952738036948452 
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security 12.104795654773502 
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications 31.157339971473622 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other 21.302599981235375 
" what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself 20.08803244907771 
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously 13.138639092064672 
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom 20.810998245432433 
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others 16.85008049553579 
" oh mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too 104.66861672614539 
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme 29.401157746695826 
mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her 14.103960546001018

" " oh yes , " said elizabeth drily " mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 27.437944289575753 
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt 21.974106452129753 
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one 11.059397546825874 
that tall , proud man 3.9658314065004387 
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr darcy then was 22.10022296588401 
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again 40.52207302362735 
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 49.92501372465147 
this letter is from mr collins 4.994223635747189

his revenge would have been complete indeed 5.851662274133631 
" " mr collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known 46.48605986817686

bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever 9.911938535987886 
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits 14.852923471213305 
" " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " _i_ never saw such a woman 26.48747408933382 
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 34.28851107810385 
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 25.940585259678578 
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before 18.278548446437277 
" " certainly , " he replied , biting his lips 10.321125086808495 
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther 20.441116598303257

follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can 21.09729552074044 
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe 37.042635969209634 
it is what every body says 4.949154492034485 
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room 41.19206548224707

colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton 16.964175535362727 
but however he did not 3.912322859786839 
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " " that is a question which mr darcy only can answer 34.166054095129674 
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess 43.99337091655513 
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation 33.32962503765595 
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 33.085095704019615 
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle 27.79508324898305 
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung 22.7605985511099

but before they heard again from mr gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise 67.51392606157371

from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce 48.82624649715388 
what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party 51.7752579962025

her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened 43.987629276260904 
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time 18.28599319487045

she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley 19.26519750873006

perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event 26.341916391425492 
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 51.73711021607138 
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured 49.76301602804659 
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex 49.66057785256343

elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 103.05403562198731 
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him 52.1017420421497

that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection 80.461686422365 
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference 27.451013323247523 
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment 57.352271503135164

colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express 17.19109703625616 
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant 69.26841415193492 
i cannot do justice to his kindness 5.941024995228263 
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her 41.95635833274636 
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true 22.89789087692573 
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield 49.10510063123842 
that reply will do for the present 6.165090968028774 
" " good heavens " cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 51.23191797811605 
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 57.344158218914245 
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt 73.71296956086461 
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game 49.03486761587304 
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down 35.04054585030919 
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do 12.298872621775205 
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham 24.487939569537563 
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him 39.54505066223199 
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room 19.215348809408855

she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once 54.32096235916805 
and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? " " she is a most charming young lady indeed 22.467583700671888 
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield 20.037088532799686 
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us 46.517789371745266 
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 13.026657114109389 
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield 42.358934770201486

it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess 12.115531118727674 
mrs wickham how well it sounds 4.879973558277203 
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room 67.0260817376391 
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly " a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings " she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? " " yes , she will remain there till christmas 133.8425867207241 
" " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first 21.13646491391117 
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies 46.75855526444175 
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do 61.89474315840997 
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected 47.767390371179744 
" with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 33.61401736987966 
" " if your master would marry , you might see more of him 13.447509399742756 
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy 61.7685472155432 
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart 22.108735339733233 
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old 43.94071130409009 
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances 64.09131420825113 
" " my object _then_ , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 58.870553493535915 
" " and so was i 5.039708697460716 
nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr bingley ' s heart were entertained 29.908180549497327 
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience 14.145466562264879

" here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of 17.899162154020814 
" did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 52.87717257566758 
well , how pleased i am and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now 32.112159953047346 
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept 53.51550783116811 
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation 40.31286249598293 
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day 22.536625847257852 
" " it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason 20.665990863962033 
mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love 56.394498180977635 
but really , ma ' am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early 41.230826246578424 
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked forward to as possible , at some future time 48.01828385464756 
" " miss bennet i am shocked and astonished 7.698292322395485 
it was first broken by mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on 54.34366584363524 
" " and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently 11.218499971562924 
" oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain 13.300131764940614 
" mr wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s 14.137188090231758 
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible 28.134599719666042

" the idea of mr collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish 80.11080787387074 
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her 21.44081691716503

on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book 55.690018305472776 
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves 17.320773724722628 
" " it _is_ wonderful , " replied wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend 28.66332682619565 
" very well 2.0149342694782835 
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend 100.83196211126177 
it pains me to offend you 5.003056810669421 
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham imagine our surprise 45.4428106560479 
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 19.835001926156338 
" " i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this " after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper 95.81201908643604 
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities 22.04316236009736 
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company 8.706887408100776 
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane 24.87830898948065 
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery 33.95110580603444 
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 19.01446012598086 
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty 12.984064169442005 
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation 23.855556794416646 
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs f 7.9422894690554156 
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one 10.975628456228907 
" " ah " cried mrs bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls 20.14254563205229 
" this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once 23.007914972918012 
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 90.81628133416055 
" " very true ; and if i had my will , we should 13.04536340890245 
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done 22.68076517046419 
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away 19.31090676160885 
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public 10.013831190590656 
you must not suspect me 3.913025524483891 
a little time therefore 2.921006331545929 
" very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " i have , sir 17.601698790871566 
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire 8.591355463481143 
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 12.95280330925705 
the adieu is charity itself 3.9281282459192317 
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son 73.26908020327328 
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him 54.05868413903768 
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 30.784246482148397 
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham 31.02255432169116 
" " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill 24.095930211688692 
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it 44.87629918613385 
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 11.859435257694352 
mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her 41.57058004609476 
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better 72.74870277261311 
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 28.04626590106665 
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 17.05394384993543 
" " _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza , " said charlotte 16.109868104878426 
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body 35.307324522402915 
" " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 65.75807961198456 
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 84.91741825402332 
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret 22.98664645833722 
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain 38.89019604384196 
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad 40.02994079403133 
" " a man who had felt less , might 9.16649272766921 
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 40.23711501617066 
i had not an idea of it 5.946955855900385 
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for 39.580424208127624 
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr darcy 24.821253948940257 
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin 20.80681154513332 
though her manner varied however , her determination never did 8.687823136389383 
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies 11.400726198699237 
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education 41.03534869838187 
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy 8.050137113362382 
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance 15.236602245204656 
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 7.914882408704712 
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour 51.04987430731215 
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise 12.001188528455042 
" " but you how are you ? " cried elizabeth 10.080734036202808 
" mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 28.797071269740773 
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself 13.178685485830803 
your ' s , c 4.086798678021703 
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet ' s civilities 34.0022120537459 
" this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley 12.836873191720283 
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 19.540636482154838 
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 30.730533930018456 
we acted with the best intentions 4.782299144424566 
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight 42.29860473275291 
jane now came up 3.0666238055635584 
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it 21.192702832124365 
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began 46.9517383842018 
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add 14.285448588832429 
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change 10.665701470447775 
nothing could console and nothing appease her 5.8468955432897545 
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference 10.027526673498018 
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival 12.962947612524756 
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing room 22.462552689541212 
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up 10.897989525636586 
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 37.90288962803452 
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal 32.176539930857615 
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up 24.124003547367185 
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball 59.391570354244664 
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 24.10488793134276 
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 10.02671065715601 
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 48.7400974519355 
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 9.135051693030416 
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself 45.11331520248011 
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts 17.140020896591338 
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned 41.898309945430796 
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine 14.485816455324194 
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 26.73894818498023 
' are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ? " " yes , ma ' am , all 20.143169713461425 
she is quite a little creature 4.930115742020033 
" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this 16.728260916838575 
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her 11.12646212888003 
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner 30.32741069566965 
" you forget that i have made no answer 8.120257616784636
