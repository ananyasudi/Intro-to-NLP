 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	3.5415831353078695

 bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	3.81580578871252
 collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power	3.9280414247804063

 such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous	3.138168665377929
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	3.7602892958272363
 bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	3.672016062946042

 she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	3.6287358520172175
 but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years	4.011690159312827

 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	3.6671450528548495

 well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king	3.761423091619809

 elizabeth, on her side, had much to do	4.171982309450734
 they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	4.209902074772337

 she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded	3.478419477483041
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	3.4242234735364954
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance	3.420226179005066

 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	3.965918484420771
 he now wished it more than ever	3.9292719309598243
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr	3.4154042160453826

 but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	3.9566875632998295
 they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs	2.886502479830188

--it was kindly meant	4.175794659325467
 within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	3.891507589914265
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	4.2397665869941425
 "oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long	3.7728133250472373

 bennet, was not so well pleased with it	4.833138082908925
 the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs	3.108067316827574
 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know of it, to another, not to you	4.354245905474714
 gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	3.8069312980811363
 darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can assure you, he informed me himself	4.017712593904433
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room	4.256529142556644
 bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more	2.989453976908135
 but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you are satisfied	3.7837812203511563
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book	3.3690593335186043
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?" "why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear	4.102139238363364
 he was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, "i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_ a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit	3.912947449367816
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible	3.338425594966114
 smiles decked the face of mrs	4.654411483595214

 darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet	5.642607283930285
 i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together	4.391802559155841
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr	3.563448165814492

 bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs	3.9602121321441124
 she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	3.873298255399124
 thank god! i have not _that_ pain	5.244753598774543

 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks	3.3252872962657505
 elizabeth was delighted	4.388169374488682
 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr	4.392045258088607
" "i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully	3.861505916662163
 the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them	3.674067183901912

 collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence	3.355846318722575
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	4.143352006092445

 collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	3.785573348795212
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	3.4294764999408107
 "i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr	4.205868624324685
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection	3.70633618843276
 he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it	3.7139891837399372

 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	4.047917136799647
 lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites	3.9950721325789345

 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her	5.066825984087913
 "do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_	3.542849000701193

 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	4.439008971284119
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment	4.16352133658672
" "i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	3.143025207148941

 elizabeth felt jane's pleasure	5.611196250677115
 hurst were going out	4.723315473206906
 hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation	4.261877903523765
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing	3.501833178593425
 he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; charlotte tried to console her	3.737903871736365

 "i am astonished, my dear," said mrs	2.9018161062620265
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	3.865085106597443
 seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence	4.056984931329619
" "but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him	3.940435637996785

 she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means	4.060031474410982
 there was also a postscript to this effect	3.3631324377303766

 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	3.167052713625728
 when first mr	4.054341676471971

 wickham and herself	4.122625717516815
 and _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter	4.056730318064673
 how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves	3.6991486362245523
 jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	4.210829278595273
 at length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction	3.2536809225139307
 i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun	3.8946182792123007
 darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence	3.6528557818185377
 "pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves	4.034587394769535

 gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write	3.8684427850444716

 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil	3.615772282318537

 "why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	4.043659211191994
 collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to mrs	3.6442646611505096

 darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning	4.406379235386455
 he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility	3.7831023333440044
 gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror	3.3804078467797996
 darcy	3.102500110013028
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs	3.476859493682952
" "in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	3.249193965066307

 i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy	4.283467420251545
 his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go	4.046814122983862
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home	3.6557494198961944
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	4.248545264874851
 her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity	3.584958691173564

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce	3.6705505406982355

 with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand	3.7087414394931204
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly	3.664619797232936
--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	2.978801643231861
"--my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	3.525958003141287

 but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me	3.576348864327613
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side	3.7516081329707625
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr	3.626081166894101
" elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more	3.400301156284396
 i am so grieved for him	3.660788502346799
 they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs	3.6523333912864318
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open	3.5825496318558825
" "are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way	3.233273173874024
 though mr	5.07836394554281
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	4.040905715026297
 but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	3.496048299163851

 elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	3.760609458851254

" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner	3.726756763984893

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables	3.5019654400774463
 they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr	3.6086427772362715

 they met several times, for there was much to be discussed	4.057471359205096
 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood	3.525494310908828

 jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	3.3754945728863253
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	3.7035104902564866
 "now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy	3.8798306753633516

" "i am," said he, with a firm voice	3.9022855071556246

 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her	3.399305989177402

 "you used us abominably ill," answered mrs	3.431131194559189
 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr	3.340606672395352
 "and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	3.6649512807877973

 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	3.660303270697141

 mr	2.25373325769127
